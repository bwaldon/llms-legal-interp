    The answer is that the damage was caused by a lightning storm, which is a natural event. This is an example of the ambiguity of natural language.

    Considering just how the word ""cause"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Cam is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,No," No.
    The answer is that the insurance policy states ""caused by a storm,"" which means caused by a storm and nothing else. It says nothing about a lightning storm or any type of storm. Thus, the damage was not caused by a storm, and the claim is denied.

    Considering just how the word ""hard surface"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Rick is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,No," No.
    The answer is that the word ""hard surface"" is an example of a construction that has been added to the word to clarify its meaning. In this case, the construction added to the word ""hail"" is ""of such intensity that it causes damage to hard surfaces or breaks glass.""

    Considering just how the word ""hard surface"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Rick is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,No," No.
    The answer is that the insurance policy uses a technical term, ""hard surface,"" which has a specific meaning that is not what one might naturally think of when hearing the word. The meaning is ""a surface made of or covered with a hard material,"" such as a roof, car or sidewalk. If Rick",,-1.2278014421463013,-0.6809264421463013,-9.567645072937012,-11.009051322937012

    Considering just how the word ""hard surface"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Rick is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",controversial,No," No.
    The answer is No because the word ""hard surface"" in the policy is a legal term of art, and its meaning is defined in the policy.
