    Harper is moving to a new home on the other side of town. Because her old home has already sold and her new home is not yet ready for her to move in, she checks into a hotel and asks her cousin Bill -- who owns a moving company -- to store some of her belongings in his personal office. A couple days before she is set to move in, Bill's office floods, which ruins the items that Bill was storing for Harper.
