John takes generally good care of his car, but over the years he has noticed a gradual buildup of rust on his front left wheel. He brings the car to a mechanic to have the wheel replaced. John files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""wear and tear"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is John covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,No," No

Considering just how the word ""outside the building"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Charlotte not covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,No," No. Why is this?
The answer is that when we use the word ""outside"" in the insurance policy, we are using it in a different sense than we would in everyday life.

Considering just how the word ""outside the building"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Charlotte not covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial,No," No. Why is this?

Considering just how the word ""rapid build-up"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Rebecca not covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,No," No. Why is this?
The answer is that ordinary speakers of English understand ""rapid"" as being quicker than normal, rather than unusually slow.  A rapid flood would therefore not be an invasion by a large volume of water.

Considering just how the word ""rapid build-up"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Rebecca not covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,No," No
The answer is No because, if a definition includes the word ""rapid,"" it is usually considered to imply that the rapid build-up is necessary for an ""invasion of the property by a large volume of water.""
