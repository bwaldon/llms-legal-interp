House Removal II,no_or_yes,"Harper's insurance covers damage from ""House Removal,"" which includes ""damage to belongings that occurs while being stored by professional removal contractors.""
Harper is moving to a new home on the other side of town. Because her old home has already sold and her new home is not yet ready for her to move in, she checks into a hotel and asks her cousin Bill to store some of her belongings at his house. A couple days before she is set to move in, Bill's house floods, which ruins the items that Bill was storing for Harper. Harper files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her belongings.
Considering just how the word ""professional movers"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Harper covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,yes," yes.

So I'm going to conclude that what Harper has done is just what a professional would do if she owned a bunch of things, and that she was very lucky that she didn't have any of the things in the lots to cause her problems. Now let's get into the questions about the damages:

Harper is moving to a new home on the other side of town.

Harper files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her belongings.
Considering just how the word ""professional movers"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Harper covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial,yes," yes.
So, is Harper covered under the $95,000 house removal? Or is she covered under her insurance policy but her old home is not?
