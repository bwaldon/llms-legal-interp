Late one night, Joanne hears loud crashing noises coming from another room in her home and knows it is just her two dogs playing together. From her bedroom, she frantically calls the police, who make a forced entry into her home to assess the situation. It turns out that the noises Joanne heard were indeed from her dogs; Joanne just wanted help subduing the dogs.
