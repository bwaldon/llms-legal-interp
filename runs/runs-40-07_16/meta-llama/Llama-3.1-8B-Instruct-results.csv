Mariam has a wall-mounted oil lamp in her living room. One night, the lamp cracks and leaks oil onto the carpet. The oil then seeps into the floor and causes significant damage. Mariam files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how ""heating installation"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, is Mariam covered by the insurance—no or yes? Final answer is:",controversial, no," no. The reason is that the phrase ""fixed oil-fired heating installation"" is a technical term that refers to a specific type of heating system, and it is not meant to include oil lamps. The phrase is not ambiguous, and it is not open to a reasonable interpretation that would include oil lamps.
