Identity Theft II,agreement,"Jack has insurance coverage against loss and damage from ""Identity Theft,"" which excludes ""identity theft connected with the policyholder's occupation.""
Jack is a successful business consultant. One day, while Jack is at home, hackers manage to infiltrate the computer network of an upscale restaurant where Jack and his colleagues frequently conduct meetings. The hackers steal Jack's credit card information and make a number of fraudulent purchases in his name. To resolve the fraud, Jack must spend thousands of dollars in legal fees. Jack files a claim with his insurance company for his losses. 
Considering just how ""connected with occupation"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, do you agree with the following statement: ""Jack is covered by the insurance.""—yes or no? Final answer is:",controversial, yes," yes.

Why? 
The phrase ""temporarily removed"" is ambiguous, and its meaning depends on the context.
