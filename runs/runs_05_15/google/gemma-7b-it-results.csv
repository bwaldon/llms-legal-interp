    Considering just how the word ""fire damage"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Ken covered by the insurance? Options: A. Ken is covered. B. Ken is not covered. Final answer is::",controversial,The,"

The answer is A.

The definition of ""Vehicle Fire"" in Ken's insurance policy covers loss or damage to the policy holder's car as a result of fire, lightning or explosion. In this case, the fire was caused by a defect in Ken's smartphone, which ignited the car's interior. Although the fire did not spread to the rest of the car, it caused significant smoke damage. Therefore, Ken is covered by his insurance policy for the damage caused by the fire.",-13.47529337,-65504,-65504,-65504,-65504
