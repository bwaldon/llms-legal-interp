Carol's bathroom wall has become severely damaged due to a pipe that slowly leaked over several days before Carol got around to calling a plumber who could fix the leak. Carol files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her wall.
Considering just how the word ""sudden/unforseen "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Carol covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes! Carol is covered by her insurance policy.
The insurance company, in its decision, reasoned that because the water flowed from an internal source (a pipe), the damage was covered.
This is a classic example of how insurance companies sometimes use the terms ""sudden/unforseen"" to mean exactly the opposite of what we would use the terms ""sudden/unforseen"" to mean.
A word of caution. If you have any doubt about what your insurance policy means, go to the trouble of reading the policy, especially the definitions. This is the best way to avoid misunderstandings.

* If water leaks from a waterbed in a bedroom, that water comes from inside the house.
* An insurance company should not be surprised by something like this.

* The key word is ""sudden"" which would not apply here.
* It was not a ""sudden"" release of water.
* It would not be an ""invasion"" because the waterbed is inside the house.
* There is no ""large volume"" of water.

While abroad, her house suffers from an electrical short circuit that causes a severe fire, damaging nearly the entire home. Vivian files a claim with her insurance company for the damages. 
    Considering just how the word ""temporarily removed"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Vivian is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes! I think it is pretty obvious that she left her house for good and only intended to go back to the house when she found a better job. It may be a little bit of a stretch but I think if she would have left her house to go back to her parents house for a while, she would have been covered. I think ""temporarily"" would have been interpreted to mean a shorter amount of time. Since she was abroad for an indeterminate amount of time, she would not be covered.

    Explanation: 
    This is a case where the meaning of the word “fire” must be considered in context. The policy insures against fire, lightning and explosion. If there was an explosion inside the car, then the insurance would cover the damage. However, an explosion is not the same thing as a fire. The word “fire” in the policy means only actual fire. 
    Likewise, a fire is not the same thing as the combustion caused by lightning. “Lightning” in the policy is defined as “loss or damage",-163.97237883042544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The fire does not spread to the rest of the car, but it causes significant smoke damage to the car's interior. Ken files a claim with his insurance company for the damage.
    Considering just how the word ""fire damage"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Ken is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes! I think it is appropriate, because the definition of Vehicle Fire in the policy does not specify where the fire must start, and it is reasonable to assume that ordinary speakers of English would interpret the phrase ""vehicle fire"" to refer to a fire that starts inside the vehicle, rather than one that starts outside the vehicle. Therefore, I think it is reasonable for the insurance company to deny Ken's claim for damages.",-102.50129115342861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

There is no debate or argument in this case. That is the law. The insurance policy is very clear. The insurance company would not have written this policy without knowing that they would be required to pay the policyholder the full amount of the claim, without any further legal action required. The insurance company would not have risked the money.
The trash truck was not a malicious act, or vandalism. They were not intentionally trying to harm Olivia's property. The policy does not apply.

    Ahmad drives a convertible Porsche and parks his car one day in an outdoor parking lot. While his car is parked in the lot, a baseball from a nearby little league game hits his car's front windshield. When he returns, he discovers the baseball on his windshield, which has been shattered beyond repair. Ahmad files a claim with his insurance company for the damage.
    Considering just how the word ""broken glass"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Ahmad is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes! I disagree.
    Please give me an answer that I can use for my paper.
No because I don't think Ahmad's insurance policy defines broken glass as something that can be caused by a baseball. The policy doesn't explicitly state that it does not cover broken glass caused by baseballs. In my opinion the insurance company should pay for the damage because it would be unreasonable to expect Ahmad to park his car in an area where there is a high chance of a baseball hitting it.
No. Ahmad's insurance policy does not specify what causes broken glass",-170.74162452388555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
