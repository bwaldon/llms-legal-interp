What is "" Key Theft ""?
In everyday use, the term "" Key theft "" is usually used to describe any theft of a key to a vehicle, especially if the vehicle is a car. However, in insurance, the term "" Key theft "" refers to a theft of a key to a vehicle used for transporting goods, for example, a van or a truck.

Considering just how the word ""key theft "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Peter covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes!

So, in this case Peter is not covered for theft of other cars, trucks and other vehicles. This is because the insurance company considers the ""key theft"" as a loss of a specific vehicle, and hence, as a loss of an insured vehicle.
This means that for the ""key replacement"" Peter is not covered for thefts of other vehicles. However, Peter is covered for thefts of his own van. So, for theft of other vehicles, Peter",-231.26925786957145,0.0,0,0.0,0.0

    Tom's house is located near a large lake.

    Solution:

It's a special insurance policy that covers audio equipment. It's not just about cars, but also about audio equipment.
