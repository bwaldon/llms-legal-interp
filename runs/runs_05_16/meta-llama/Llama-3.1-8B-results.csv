Carol's bathroom wall has become severely damaged due to a pipe that slowly leaked over several days before Carol got around to calling a plumber who could fix the leak. Carol files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her wall.
Considering just how the word ""sudden/unforseen "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Carol covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes! Carol is covered by her insurance policy.
The insurance company, in its decision, reasoned that because the water flowed from an internal source (a pipe), the damage was covered.
This is a classic example of how insurance companies sometimes use the terms ""sudden/unforseen"" to mean exactly the opposite of what we would use the terms ""sudden/unforseen"" to mean.
A word of caution. If you have any doubt about what your insurance policy means, go to the trouble of reading the policy, especially the definitions. This is the best way to avoid misunderstandings.

* If water leaks from a waterbed in a bedroom, that water comes from inside the house.
* An insurance company should not be surprised by something like this.

* The key word is ""sudden"" which would not apply here.
* It was not a ""sudden"" release of water.
* It would not be an ""invasion"" because the waterbed is inside the house.
* There is no ""large volume"" of water.

    Explanation: 
    This is a case where the meaning of the word “fire” must be considered in context. The policy insures against fire, lightning and explosion. If there was an explosion inside the car, then the insurance would cover the damage. However, an explosion is not the same thing as a fire. The word “fire” in the policy means only actual fire. 
    Likewise, a fire is not the same thing as the combustion caused by lightning. “Lightning” in the policy is defined as “loss or damage",-163.88338815327734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The insurance company would not have written this policy without knowing that they would be required to pay the policyholder the full amount of the claim, without any further legal action required. The insurance company would not have risked the money.

    Please give me an explanation of your answer in the space below.
    Note that the following is not a ""crack"" (as this term is defined in law): a hole through which oil leaks. If the hole was caused by a ""crack,"" then the heater has not leaked oil but has exploded. ""Oil leaks from a fixed oil-fired heating installation"" thus includes holes in the heater as long as the holes are not caused by explosions.

    Key theft does not qualify as a covered risk under the policy. The insurance policy contains the phrase ""loss or damage to the vehicle."" The word ""key"" is not mentioned in the policy. Even though key theft will eventually result in ""loss or damage"" to the vehicle, that is not what the policy covers.

    Although I do not know how courts would apply this language to the facts stated, it seems to me that this should not be an insurance claim which would be covered. The insurance policy is not for the keys but for the vehicle, and I think that the ordinary meaning of ""theft"" would be that the thief would carry off the vehicle or something of value from the vehicle.

No because I don't think Ahmad's insurance policy defines broken glass as something that can be caused by a baseball. The policy doesn't explicitly state that it does not cover broken glass caused by baseballs. In my opinion the insurance company should pay for the damage because it would be unreasonable to expect Ahmad to park his car in an area where there is a high chance of a baseball hitting it.

        Justin, a skilled plumber, is repairing his leaky kitchen sink when he inadvertently punctures a pipe that leads to the kitchen. In order to access and repair the damaged pipe, Justin has to tear out drywall and tear up floorboards. He files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
    Considering just how the word ""necessary and reasonable"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Justin covered by the insurance? Options: A. Justin is not covered. B. Justin is covered. Final answer is:",controversial,Justin," Justin is not covered.
    Explanation: The use of the word ""necessary"" and ""reasonable"" in the definition of ""Trace and Access"" implies that the costs incurred by Justin in locating and fixing the damaged pipe should be necessary and reasonable. Since Justin is a skilled plumber, it is likely that he has the necessary knowledge and expertise to locate and fix the damaged pipe without tearing out drywall and floorboards. Therefore, the costs incurred by Justin in locating and fixing the damaged pipe are not considered necessary and reasonable, and he is not covered by the insurance",-64.67183096606459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
