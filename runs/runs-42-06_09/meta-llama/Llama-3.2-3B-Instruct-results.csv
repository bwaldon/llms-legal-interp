Considering just how ""causative ""from"""" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Tom not covered by the insurance? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered, Yes," Yes

Explanation: Because of the word ""from,"" one would naturally assume that the policy intends to cover damage caused by winds with gusts of at most 54 mph.

Why is the word ""cause"" ambiguous when it comes to ""Storm Damage""?

One day, a hail storm hits Rick's house and causes damage to the plants on his balcony. Many plants lose leaves and some are completely covered in ice, causing them to die. Rick files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how ""hard surface"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Rick not covered by the insurance? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered, Yes," Yes

Explanation: Because of the obvious ambiguity of the phrase ""hard surfaces"", and because a common understanding of the term is to exclude soft surfaces, most courts would rule that this policy would not cover the damage. The idea that a ""hail storm"" could damage ""soft surfaces"" like plants is absurd. In",,-1.3169900178909302,-1.002366304397583,-8.080491065979004,-9.658616065979004

Cooper, who keeps a GPS-tracked smartphone in his car to play music and for navigation, goes on vacation and leaves his car in his home garage. However, surveillance footage captures a masked assailant breaking into his car and driving away. Cooper files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
Considering just how ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Do you agree with the following statement: Cooper is not covered by the insurance. Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial, Yes," Yes

I disagree with the statement, because an ordinary speaker of English would interpret the word ""tracking"" to mean following or monitoring, not specifically a device. Therefore, Cooper's car would be covered under the policy if he was not using the tracking device when the car was stolen. The answer is: No.
