Considering just how the word ""wear and tear"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is John covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,No," No. Since the gradual buildup of rust is a predictable and expected consequence of the normal passage of time, the damage from rust would be seen as a form of wear and tear.

Explanation: The term ""wear and tear"" is typically understood to refer to gradual deterioration or damage that results from routine use of a product.

John files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""wear and tear"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is John covered by the insurance?? No or Yes?
