House Removal II,no_or_yes,"Harper's insurance covers damage from ""House Removal,"" which includes ""damage to belongings that occurs while being stored by professional removal contractors.""
Harper is moving to a new home on the other side of town. Because her old home has already sold and her new home is not yet ready for her to move in, she checks into a hotel and asks her cousin Bill -- who owns a moving company -- to store some of her belongings in his personal office. A couple days before she is set to move in, Bill's office floods, which ruins the items that Bill was storing for Harper. Harper files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her belongings.
Considering just how the word ""professional movers"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Harper covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes

Here is why: Harper hired a professional mover, who was in fact a professional removal contractor, to move her belongings. Therefore, this situation qualifies for coverage under Harper's insurance policy.

    I would say that no, he isn't covered. The insurance company probably means ""fire damage"" to mean something that was the result of a fire. ""Fire damage"" would be something burned, melted, or otherwise obviously damaged by fire. I think a smoldering cigarette would be considered ""smoke damage"" and wouldn't be covered.

    If you don't agree, you'll have to explain in detail your reasoning, but I think the answer is yes.

    If you agree, the law may have defined the word ""leaking"" in such a way that Madison is not covered.

    There is a reason that those who draft legislation do not rely on dictionaries. They have to define their terms for themselves, and they can do it in ways that have nothing to do with ordinary usage.

    And, of course, when the legislator defines ""leaking"" as ""leaking from a fixed oil-fired heating installation"" he has used a grammatical construction that ordinary speakers of English do not use.

    1. The pipe broke in the wall when Carol was away, so there was no reason to think that it was the pipe which was the problem, and she would not have called the plumber until she came back. There was no reason to think it was going to break when she was away. So the damage was caused by an unforeseen event.

    I disagree. I think ""leaking"" would be understood as a leak of liquid oil, and that's not what's happening here. It seems clear that ""leaking"" would not cover this, since that would make it too easy to cheat insurance companies.

    So, I think this is a ""good"" riddle, one that can teach us a bit about language and legal documents.

    It depends on the details of the insurance contract. In general, the insurance covers fire, but ""smoke damage"" is not necessarily a consequence of fire.

I believe Hunter is covered, because an accessory is a tool that assists or helps a person in committing a crime or some other wrongdoing.

    Considering just how the word ""accessory"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Hunter is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,No," No. I disagree. The word ""accessory"" is not understood in its common sense, but in the sense of legal terms and concepts. The courts have defined this term to mean that the item is only considered an accessory if it is intended to be used with the car. Thus, Hunter's seat covers are considered ""car accessories"" under the policy.
