Carol's bathroom wall has become severely damaged due to a pipe that slowly leaked over several days before Carol got around to calling a plumber who could fix the leak. Carol files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her wall.
Considering just how the word ""sudden/unforseen "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Carol covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes! Carol is covered by her insurance policy.
The insurance company, in its decision, reasoned that because the water flowed from an internal source (a pipe), the damage was covered.
This is a classic example of how insurance companies sometimes use the terms ""sudden/unforseen"" to mean exactly the opposite of what we would use the terms ""sudden/unforseen"" to mean.
A word of caution. If you have any doubt about what your insurance policy means, go to the trouble of reading the policy, especially the definitions. This is the best way to avoid misunderstandings.

* If water leaks from a waterbed in a bedroom, that water comes from inside the house.
* An insurance company should not be surprised by something like this.

    Explanation: 
    This is a case where the meaning of the word “fire” must be considered in context. The policy insures against fire, lightning and explosion. If there was an explosion inside the car, then the insurance would cover the damage. However, an explosion is not the same thing as a fire. The word “fire” in the policy means only actual fire. 
    Likewise, a fire is not the same thing as the combustion caused by lightning. “Lightning” in the policy is defined as “loss or damage",-163.88338815327734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I think it is appropriate, because the definition of Vehicle Fire in the policy does not specify where the fire must start, and it is reasonable to assume that ordinary speakers of English would interpret the phrase ""vehicle fire"" to refer to a fire that starts inside the vehicle, rather than one that starts outside the vehicle.

There is no debate or argument in this case. That is the law. The insurance policy is very clear. The insurance company would not have written this policy without knowing that they would be required to pay the policyholder the full amount of the claim, without any further legal action required. The insurance company would not have risked the money.
The trash truck was not a malicious act, or vandalism. They were not intentionally trying to harm Olivia's property. The policy does not apply.

    Note that the following is not a ""crack"" (as this term is defined in law): a hole through which oil leaks. If the hole was caused by a ""crack,"" then the heater has not leaked oil but has exploded. ""Oil leaks from a fixed oil-fired heating installation"" thus includes holes in the heater as long as the holes are not caused by explosions.

    Please give me an answer that I can use for my paper.
No because I don't think Ahmad's insurance policy defines broken glass as something that can be caused by a baseball. The policy doesn't explicitly state that it does not cover broken glass caused by baseballs. In my opinion the insurance company should pay for the damage because it would be unreasonable to expect Ahmad to park his car in an area where there is a high chance of a baseball hitting it.
No. Ahmad's insurance policy does not specify what causes broken glass",-170.755411288701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
