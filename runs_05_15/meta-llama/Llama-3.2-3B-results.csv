    One day, Gwen drives her SUV to the grocery store. While looking for a parking space, she injures her wrist when her SUV collides with another car. This incident ultimately leads to thousands of dollars in medical expenses. Gwen files a claim with her insurance company for the damages. 
    Considering just how the word ""traveling in "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Gwen is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes! Gwen is not covered by her car insurance because she was not in the car when the accident occurred.
    Here's why: ""Personal Accident"" only covers damages arising from the car itself. That's why if you're injured while driving your car, your car insurance will pay for your injuries, up to the policy limit. But if you're injured while walking, riding a bike, or something else, your car insurance won't cover it. That's because your car is not the thing that injured you. The thing that injured you is your body, not your car.

Vehicle Theft VI,agreement_negation,"Cooper's car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Theft,"" which applies only if ""the policyholder's car contains a working GPS tracking device.""
    Cooper, who doesn't keep a GPS tracking device in his car, goes on vacation and leaves his car in his home garage. However, surveillance footage captures a masked assailant breaking into his car and driving away. Cooper files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
    Considering just how the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Cooper is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes! 
    This is an obvious case of a gap between the terms of the policy and the plain language of the policy. Yes, there is an ambiguity about what a ""tracking device"" means. But this ambiguity is resolved in favor of Cooper. Cooper's policy does not require him to use any particular kind of device; it only requires him to install a ""working"" GPS tracking device. But how do we know that ""working"" means ""not broken?"" 
    The ""working"" of the device is not defined anywhere in the policy. However, we can use the ordinary meaning of the word ""working""",-181.06947878724895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

    Considering just how the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Cooper is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes! 
    Because of the obvious ambiguity of the phrase ""tracking device,"" and because a tracking device is already explicitly mentioned in the policy, the courts hold that this language must be read as a condition rather than an exclusion. 
    This means that Cooper's policy does not exclude coverage for his car's loss. 
    Had the policy written the exclusion differently, the courts would have likely read the exclusion as an exclusion, as long as it was clearly worded and there were no ambiguities.

    Because of the obvious ambiguity of the phrase ""tracking device,"" and because a tracking device is already explicitly mentioned in the ""Vehicle Theft"" section of Cooper's policy, the law of contract interpretation requires us to give the clause an ordinary meaning. ""Working"" is a familiar adjective in the context of the phrase ""tracking device.""

    Carol's bathroom wall has become severely damaged due to a pipe that slowly leaked over several days before Carol got around to calling a plumber who could fix the leak. Carol files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her wall.

    If you don't agree, use the following to explain your reasoning and why you disagree with the statement.
    Consider the following: The insurance company may deny Peter's claim based on the fact that Peter has insurance that covers ""Loss or Damage to a Goods Carrying Vehicle,"" which includes ""key replacement in the case of theft."" This is because, given the ordinary understanding of the word ""theft,"" it is not clear that a key is stolen or taken. Peter's claim may be denied because it is not clear whether the key was taken, or if Peter just left the key in his van.
