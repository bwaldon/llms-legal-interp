Considering just how the word ""wear and tear"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is John covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes! 
Remember: The word ""wear and tear"" has a very specific meaning in a commercial insurance policy. An insurance company will not be held liable for the ordinary decay and deterioration of a car.
