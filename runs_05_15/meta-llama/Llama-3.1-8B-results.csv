    One day, Ken parks his car next to his home, and while he is out on a jog his neighbor's home catches fire. The fire spreads to Ken's car, which is subsequently destroyed in the blaze. Ken files a claim with his insurance company for the damage.

    Explanation: 
    This is a case where the meaning of the word “fire” must be considered in context. The policy insures against fire, lightning and explosion. If there was an explosion inside the car, then the insurance would cover the damage. However, an explosion is not the same thing as a fire. The word “fire” in the policy means only actual fire. 
    Likewise, a fire is not the same thing as the combustion caused by lightning. “Lightning” in the policy is defined as “loss or damage",-163.88338815327734

    One day, Ken parks his car next to his home and leaves behind his smartphone, which catches fire later that day due to a defect. The fire does not spread to the rest of the car, but it causes significant smoke damage to the car's interior. Ken files a claim with his insurance company for the damage.
    Considering just how the word ""fire damage"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Ken is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes! I think it is appropriate, because the definition of Vehicle Fire in the policy does not specify where the fire must start, and it is reasonable to assume that ordinary speakers of English would interpret the phrase ""vehicle fire"" to refer to a fire that starts inside the vehicle, rather than one that starts outside the vehicle. Therefore, I think it is reasonable for the insurance company to deny Ken's claim for damages.",-102.5605452232121

No because I don't think Ahmad's insurance policy defines broken glass as something that can be caused by a baseball. The policy doesn't explicitly state that it does not cover broken glass caused by baseballs.
