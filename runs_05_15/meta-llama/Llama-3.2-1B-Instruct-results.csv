Let's analyze the situation:

- The definition of wear and tear is something that happens to a car over time, and it is something that ordinary speakers of English would understand.
- John is bringing his car in for a replacement because the damage was caused by an accident, and an accident is an event that is beyond the normal wear and tear of the vehicle. Therefore, the cost of the repair would be considered excessive wear and tear. 
- John's insurance policy would cover the cost of the repair, since it is beyond the normal wear and tear of the vehicle.

Therefore, John is covered by the insurance policy.",-137.60247254181013

The only condition mentioned in John's insurance policy is that coverage will be excluded if John's car is damaged as a result of ""loss or damage caused by wear and tear.""
