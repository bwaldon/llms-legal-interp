Emergency Damages I,yes_or_no,"Joanne's home insurance covers ""Emergency Damages,"" defined as ""loss or damage to the contents of the policyholder's home caused when first responders force an entry into the policyholder's home because of an emergency or perceived emergency involving the policyholder.""
Late one night, Joanne hears loud crashing noises coming from another room in her home and knows it is just her two dogs playing together. From her bedroom, she frantically calls the police, who make a forced entry into her home to assess the situation. It turns out that the noises Joanne heard were indeed from her dogs; Joanne just wanted help subduing the dogs.

Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes. I think it is appropriate to interpret ""perceived emergency"" in this context as a subjective state of the policyholder, rather than an objective state of the world.

Considering just how the word ""leaking "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Madison covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes.
*   This is an ""escape"" of oil, but in a very different sense than the one the policy had in mind. If the insurance company were to prevail, they would be saying that only oil that is leaking from a heating installation that is ""fixed"" is covered, but oil that is leaking from a heating installation that is ""loose"" is not covered. This would be an absurd result. Therefore, the court would probably side with Madison.
*   Note that the policy would not cover damage from ""spilling"" or ""knocking over"" oil, so Madison would not be covered if she had simply knocked over the kerosene can. But since she slipped and spilled it, the court would probably find that this is covered.

Escape of Oil I,yes_or_no,"Madison has insurance that covers home damage from ""Escape of Oil,"" defined as ""oil leaking from a fixed oil-fired heating installation.""
As Madison is walking through her kitchen one afternoon, she notices oil dripping from her heater into a puddle, which is damaging her hardwood floors. Madison files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""leaking "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Madison covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes.
It is possible to imagine cases in which a heater might be said to be leaking oil without any oil actually escaping from it. For example, Madison might pour oil into a leaky hose leading to the heater, which would then drain the oil from the hose onto the floor. In this case, it could be said that the heater is ""leaking"" oil, even though no oil is actually escaping from the heater itself.
So it is very important to say that there is ""oil leaking from the heater,"" not that the heater is leaking oil. Saying that there is ""oil leaking from the heater"" implies that the oil is escaping from the heater, not from somewhere else. And in that case, Madison is covered by the insurance.

It is possible to imagine cases in which a heater might be said to be leaking oil without any oil actually coming out. For example, a heater might be leaking oil if the reservoir inside were not properly sealed and oil were seeping through the walls of the reservoir without exiting the heater at all. This reading is generally available in cases of ""leaking"" where the word suggests a gradual and subtle flow of liquid, such as a leaky faucet.

Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes. I think it is appropriate to interpret ""heating installation"" in a common sense way. If you ask someone on the street ""what is an oil-fired heating installation?"" they would likely say something like ""you know, a heater for your house."" However, in law, we often use words in a more technical sense. I think ""heating installation"" is ambiguous. I think a reasonable reading of ""heating installation"" could include an oil lamp that is designed for heating.

It may be worth noting that this answer is based on the interpretation of an exclusion clause, and the interpretation of exclusions is often more liberal than the interpretation of coverage clauses.

It is possible to argue, in an adversarial case, that the common usage of the word ""heating installation"" should not be relied on, and that a narrow interpretation of the word should be used. However, in a non-adversarial case, such as a case between an insured and her insurance company, it would be normal to rely on the ordinary usage of the word ""heating installation"", and thus Mariam would be covered.

The final answer is: Yes.  The fire was naturally occurring - it was a naturally occurring fire caused by the explosion of a gas-powered grill.  An explosion is the rapid release of energy, and if the energy is caused by a chemical reaction, then the explosion is naturally occurring.

Charlotte lives alone in a one-story home. One day, a car hits a fire hydrant outside her home, causing a large volume of water to suddenly seep into her home. This causes significant water damage to her basement. Charlotte files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""outside the building"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Charlotte covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes. I think it is correct, because although the water started outside of Charlotte's building, it came to be inside the building when it flowed under the foundation of the building and into the basement. That's what ""outside the building"" would mean to ordinary people, not ""outside the building's boundary"".

It is possible to argue, in an adversarial case, that the rapid build-up in question is the rise of the creek over several years, which may make Rebecca's claim fall outside the terms of her policy.

Harper is moving to a new home on the other side of town.

Harper is moving to a new home on the other side of town.

Considering just how the word ""professional movers"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Harper covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes. I think it is pretty obvious that an ordinary speaker of English would think that ""professional movers"" includes the movers who work for a company owned by Harper's cousin, and that the word ""professional"" is being used to distinguish between people who do this for a living and people who do it as a hobby. Since Harper's cousin is a professional mover, this clause should cover Harper.

Considering just how the word ""connected with business"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Jason covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes.  Jason is covered. The word ""connected with"" is in the meaning of ""arising out of"" or ""causing.""  That is, this language excludes the policy from covering any claims arising out of Jason's use of his identity in any capacity in connection with his business.

Explanation: Because Jason is a car salesman, one might initially assume that he is a business owner and thus wouldn't be covered by the policy. But the ordinary meaning of the word ""business"" would be something like ""employment,"" rather than ""ownership of a business."" Thus, since Jason is employed as a car salesman, the exclusion would apply.  The policyholder's business would be his occupation as a car salesman.

Considering just how the word ""connected with occupation"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Jack covered by the insurance?? Yes or No?

The word ""connected with"" is in the meaning of a relationship between the event (the hacking) and the occupation (of business consultant).  The event is not connected with the occupation, but the use of Jack's credit card information was. Thus, the hacking is not connected with the occupation.

I think it is appropriate to interpret the exclusion as applying to identity theft only when it is caused by the policyholder's occupation, and not to mere association of the theft with the policyholder's occupation. So I would answer ""Yes"".  It was a tough call.  I think the policy should be interpreted in a way that covers the call of facts, because the exclusion is a specific exception, and the policyholder was not involved in the theft or related activities, and the occupation of the policyholder, business consultant, is very general",-184.3677052,-6.261508465,-7.066195965,-65504,-65504

Considering just how the word ""temporarily removed"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Vivian covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: This question tests understanding of the word ""temporarily."" This word does not mean ""temporarily with the intention of returning."" Rather, it means ""for a short time."" In this case, if Vivian lives abroad for an extended period of time, even though she has no intention of returning, she would still be considered ""temporarily"" away from her home, and thus would be covered.

Considering just how the word ""temporarily removed"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Vivian covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes

The final answer is: Yes
Got it. Explanation: 
The phrase ""temporarily away from home"" is used in this context. ""Temporarily"" refers to the duration of the absence, and ""away from home"" refers to the location of the absence. Thus, Vivian is temporarily away from home even if she is physically away from her home, as long as she is not permanently absent. Therefore, Vivian is covered by the insurance.

Explanation: This question tests understanding of the word ""temporarily."" This word does not mean ""permanently,"" but rather ""for a short period of time."" Thus, Vivian's decision to keep the house and return one day means that she was not ""temporarily removed"" from the house. This situation would be quite difficult for the average person to understand because the word ""temporarily"" is so often used in a way that suggests permanence (e.g., ""I'm temporarily laid off,"" which means that one has been laid off permanently until",-132.2389846,-5.808891296,-5.941703796,-65504,-65504

Considering just how the word ""key theft "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Peter covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes. I think it is appropriate to interpret ""key theft"" as synonymous with ""loss or theft of the key"", or ""theft of the key"".
In this case, the key is lost, rather than stolen, but the insurance company should cover the cost of replacing the key, since the loss of the key could have been prevented if the thief had not stolen the van. Therefore, I would answer Yes. It is more important to look at the purpose of the policy - to cover the owner of a goods carrying vehicle in case the key is lost, not to limit the policy to cases where the key is stolen. Therefore, the phrase ""key theft"" should be interpreted as synonymous with",-180.0369513,-5.121310711,-4.769748211,-65504,-65504

Considering just how the word ""key theft "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Peter covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes. I think the word ""theft"" would be understood to be key theft, a mugging in the sense of someone stealing a key. That is, ordinary language and the language of insurance contracts are distinct and the interpretation should not be literal.
The rationale of this answer is as follows:
First, we must look at the language of the policy. Is ""key replacement in the case of theft"" a policy that covers ""theft of keys?"" or does it cover ""theft of the van?"" Since Peter is claiming for the cost of replacing a key, it seems more likely that the former is meant.

Considering just how the word ""deliberate"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Olivia covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,No," No.
Olivia is not covered by the garbage truck incident because it was not a ""malicious act"" or ""vandalism.""

Tom's house is located near a large lake.

Explanation: This is an ""accidental"" example of a problem in the law of causation. The wind caused Tom's loss (he fell from the roof) and the fall caused the damage. The wind is therefore causative of the damage, even if its immediate cause was Tom's loss.

## Step 1: Understand the policy definition of ""Wind Damage""
The policy defines ""Wind Damage"" as damage from wind speeds with gusts of at least 55 mph.

## Step 2: Consider the source of the wind
The damage occurred due to winds that came from a large lake. This means the winds originated over water, which can pick up speed as it moves over land due to its lower friction.

## Step 3: Analyze if the wind speed would meet the policy's criteria

Storm Damage,yes_or_no,"Cam's home insurance policy includes coverage for ""Storm Damage,"" defined as ""damage caused by a storm.""
One day, a lightning storm passes through Cam's neighborhood and lightning hits his neighborhood's power plant, causing a power outage.

Explanation: Because of the word ""cause,"" one might initially think that Cam is not covered because the storm did not directly cause the fire. However, the ordinary meaning of the word ""cause"" includes being a necessary condition for an event or action to occur. The storm caused the fire in this sense because the storm would not have caused the fire if it had not knocked out the power and thus made it impossible for Cam to have used a power-dependent tool (like a power drill) to reset the circuit breaker, thus the storm is a necessary condition to the fire.

Storm Damage,yes_or_no,"Cam's home insurance policy includes coverage for ""Storm Damage,"" defined as ""damage caused by a storm.""
One day, a lightning storm passes through Cam's neighborhood and lightning hits his roof, causing a fire. Almost all of his roof burns before firefighters manage to extinguish it. Cam files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""cause"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Cam covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes

The correct answer is Yes.

The word ""cause"" in ""Storm Damage"" would be understood to mean ""result from"" or ""be a result of.""  Thus, Cam is covered by the policy if the damage was caused by a storm, which means that the damage was a result of a storm. Since the fire on Cam's roof was a result of the lightning, which was part of the storm, the damage was indeed a result of a storm. Therefore, Cam is covered by the insurance. 

The idea of cause as used in the legal context is different from the way ordinary speakers of English use it. In the legal context, ""cause"" means ""give rise to"" or ""lead to.""  If the insurance policy said ""Storm",-139.5674489,-5.321625233,-5.696625233,-65504,-65504

Considering just how the word ""cause"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Cam covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the idea that one event can cause another in a series of events, the series of events from lightning striking the power line, to the power surge, to the fire, to the damage, is a chain of causation that can support a claim for damage to Cam's property. Most people would likely use the word ""cause"" in this way. The word ""cause"" would not be limited to immediate cause (the power surge).  Therefore, the policy would cover the damage.  The ordinary usage of the word ""cause"" supports a broad interpretation of the term, supporting coverage for Cam. Therefore, the answer is: Yes.",-170.584861,-5.41033268,-5.66033268,-65504,-65504

One day, a hail storm hits Rick's house and causes damage to the plants on his balcony. Many plants lose leaves and some are completely covered in ice, causing them to die. Rick files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""hard surface"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Rick covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the word ""hard surfaces"" in the policy, and because a plant can be regarded as a hard surface, Rick is covered by the insurance.  The key word is ""hard surfaces"" which would be understood by ordinary speakers of English as including plants.  The use of the word ""or"" between ""hard surfaces"" and ""breaks glass"" indicates that each word is being used in the sense of ""one way to describe a thing,"" rather than as ""an alternative way that the thing can be described.""  In other words, the word ""hard surfaces"" is being used to describe what plants are, and the word ""breaks glass"" is",-150.0727009,-5.526997566,-5.362935066,-65504,-65504

One day, a hail storm hits Rick's house and causes damage to his roof's clay shingles. Many shingles are chipped and some even develop large cracks, causing the roof to leak. Rick files a claim with his insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""hard surface"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Rick covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes.
It is possible to argue, in an adversarial context, that ""hard surface"" refers to something with a hard outer layer, such as metal or wood, but this interpretation would not be the only one and is arguably not the most common one. Clay shingles, which are made from earth materials, do not have a hard outer layer, but they are hard in the sense that they cannot be easily scratched or broken by normal objects. It is not clear that ordinary speakers of English would understand the phrase ""hard surface"" to exclude clay shingles, especially since the context is a roof, which is made from various materials, including clay shingles.

One day, a hail storm hits Rick's house and causes damage to his skylight window. The window is chipped, but the roof is not leaking. Rick files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""hard surface"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Rick covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the word ""hard surface"", Rick's skylight window would be covered by the policy. Hard surfaces are surfaces that are hard to the touch and the skylight is a hard surface. Skylights are hard surfaces that can be damaged in a hail storm. Hail is just the right size and weight to chip the glass on a skylight, which would be considered a ""hard surface."" Additionally, a skylight is definitely a ""hard surface"" when compared to a soft surface such as grass or a tree, for example. The policy is therefore clear that Rick's skylight window would be covered in case of a hail storm.

Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Blake covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes

## Step 1: Understand the definition of ""Ground Heave""
The policy defines ""Ground Heave"" as ""loss or damage resulting from ground heave of the site on which the building stands, or landslip."" This means that the damage must be a result of the ground itself moving up or the site slipping.

## Step 2: Analyze the cause of the damage
The damage to Blake's house foundation was caused by the impact from two semi trucks colliding with each other outside his house, making the house shake.

## Step 3: Determine if the cause fits the definition

One day, Clint hears a loud crash in his house and finds that his roof has partly caved in due to water damage. Clint files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Clint covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes

The final answer is: Yes.  The reason is that in the common usage of the word ""heave"", heave can be an upward movement of something, and the word ""ground heave"" can be understood as an upward movement of the ground, which is what happened in this case.  This means that the definition of ""ground heave"" is sufficiently broad to cover a ground heave in an upward direction.  Therefore, Clint is covered by the insurance.

One day, Clint hears a loud crash in his house and finds that the ground beneath his house has shifted, causing his house's foundation to crack. Clint files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Clint covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes

The best answer is Yes.  I think that is correct, because the word ""heave"" is a verb that means ""to rise or fall suddenly, especially because of movement or pressure under the surface of the earth.""  Since the ground beneath Clint's house has shifted, causing his house's foundation to crack, it seems likely that the ground has ""heaved."" Therefore, it would be reasonable to interpret the policy as covering this sort of damage.

Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Clint covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes

The best answer is Yes.  I think that is correct, because the word ""ground"" in the term ""ground heave"" is used to refer to the earth on which the building is standing. So the damage was caused by a ""landslip"" (the falling of the earth) and the insurance would cover the damage. The term ""ground heave"" is used to refer to the upward movement of the earth (like an upheaval), whereas a ""landslip"" is a downward movement, but both are instances of the earth moving.

The definition of ""Trace and Access"" does not specify any material conditions (e.g., ""any"" costs incurred etc.).

Key Rule: Reasonableness is determined by a reasonable person standard, not an objective standard.
Analysis: 
The language of the policy is broad, leaving it to the reader's interpretation. The term ""necessary and reasonable"" implies that the reasonableness is determined by the situation, not by an objective standard. A reasonable person standard suggests that a person would be expected to take certain actions under the same circumstances. Therefore, Justin's actions of tearing out drywall and floorboards in order to access and repair the damaged pipe can be seen as necessary and reasonable.

Jenny was not in custody or control of her car at the time the damage occurred. She left the car on the street, and it was not under her custody or control. The key was left in the house. Therefore, she should be covered.

Explanation: Because Jenny gave her car key to her neighbor, that meant the neighbor was in lawful possession of the car, and thus in its custody or control, but this was merely by permission.

Vehicle Damage II,yes_or_no,"John's car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Damage,"" which excludes ""loss or damage caused by wear and tear.""
John takes generally good care of his car, but over the years he has noticed a gradual buildup of rust on his front left wheel. He brings the car to a mechanic to have the wheel replaced. John files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""wear and tear"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is John covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes

The final answer is: Yes. 

The reason is that in ordinary English, ""wear and tear"" is understood to refer to gradual deterioration over time, rather than to damage that occurs through some form of accident or unexpected event. Since John's car was damaged in a mechanical failure, and not through any accident or unexpected event, the damage is not excluded by the policy. 

Here's the reasoning again in a more formal way:

The term ""wear and tear"" is vague and ambiguous. It is unclear from the term alone whether it is intended to exclude gradual deterioration over time, or whether it is intended to exclude only damage that occurs through some form of accident or unexpected event.

Considering just how the word ""wear and tear"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is John covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: This question requires understanding of the concept of wear and tear. This concept is often understood to mean damage or deterioration caused by repeated use, which may be beyond the power of the individual to prevent. John's accident was caused by an external event, not by repeated use, so he is covered.  Answer is: Yes. (However, it would be reasonable to doubt that a lawyer would agree with this answer.)

Explanation: This question tests understanding of the definition of ""wear and tear."" The term refers to the deterioration of an item from ordinary use. An accident, which is a sudden event, would not be considered ""ordinary use,"" so John should be covered.  Answer is Yes.

The best answer is Yes.  I think that is wrong.  This is a difficult question because the term ""audio equipment"" is ambiguous.  It could mean a hi-fi sound system, or it could mean any equipment that produces or records sound, like a laptop.  The question is written to make the speaker use the narrow interpretation, which is probably the right interpretation, but it is not the only possible interpretation.  I think that is right, but there is a possibility that the speaker will give the broad interpretation, and conclude that the policy holder is covered.

Considering just how the word ""audio equipment"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Chris covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes

The best answer is Yes.  I think that is correct, because the policy defines Vehicle Damage to include damage to audio equipment, and the claim involves damage to a car stereo system and speakers. Those are types of audio equipment.  So, the claim should be covered.  That is, it should be covered even if the policy holder did not have audio equipment in mind when he bought the policy.  For, as long as a reasonable person would have understood the policy to cover the claim, then it should be covered.  This is the reasonable expectations doctrine.

The best answer is Yes.  I'll go through it in the words of a typical college student:

The word ""audio equipment"" is used here to refer to electronic devices that produce or record sound. So, this would include things like microphones, speakers, and headphones. Since a portable Bluetooth speaker is something that produces sound, it is certainly an audio equipment. The word ""equipment"" is not being used here in some special sense that would refer only to car parts or only to built-in features.

Hunter, who lives alone, goes on vacation and leaves his car in his home garage. However, surveillance footage captures a masked assailant breaking into his car and stealing several hundred dollars in bills that Hunter left in the car. Hunter files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
Considering just how the word ""accessory"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Hunter covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Hunter is entitled to coverage for theft of his car accessories (the money). Ordinary speakers of English would understand ""accessory"" to include something used with a car, like money.  This is an example of a ""dictionary definition"" interpretation of a contract. The language of the contract is to be interpreted according to its ordinary, dictionary definition.  Other courts might have reached a different conclusion if they felt that using the money for an unlawful purpose (theft) was inconsistent with the intent of the parties, but this is not the way to read a contract.

Hunter, who lives alone, goes on vacation and leaves his car in his home garage. However, surveillance footage captures a masked assailant breaking into his car and stealing Hunter's very high-end seat covers. Hunter files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
Considering just how the word ""accessory"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Hunter covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the plain meaning of the word ""accessory"", and because a seat cover is indeed an accessory to a car.  See Black's Law Dictionary, which defines ""accessory"" as something added to something else for ornamentation, convenience, or other purposes.  The average person would not think of a seat cover as being anything other than an accessory. Therefore, a seat cover would be within the coverage of the policy.  By contrast, there is no evidence that the thief took the car itself.  Thus, the word ""car"" in the policy is not relevant to this case.

However, surveillance footage captures a masked assailant breaking into his car and stealing a smartphone that Hunter leaves in the car for navigation and to play music.

Considering just how the word ""accessory"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Hunter covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Hunter is covered by the insurance. A car accessory is defined as an item attached to or used with the car, such as a phone mount for a car, which would fit the definition of being something used ""with"" the car. It does not mean something which is merely associated with the car. Since the phone is an item that is used with the car, it qualifies as an accessory.  Answer is: Yes. 75.

Dillon, who employs a part-time personal assistant, goes on vacation and leaves his car in his home garage. However, surveillance footage captures his personal assistant breaking into his car and driving away. Dillon files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
Considering just how the word ""family or employee"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Dillon covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the word ""ex-"" before ""employee,"" the phrase ""employee or ex-employee"" is likely to be understood as covering past employees, not current employees. Therefore, Dillon's personal assistant is not a covered person, and Dillon's claim is covered.  Answer is: Yes.  Key Insight: Ordinary meaning of the words.  Key Rule: Unambiguous policy language controls.  Key Concept: Ex-employee.  Legal Issue: Insurance - policy interpretation.

Considering just how the word ""family or employee"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Dillon covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because no family or household members were involved in the theft, and because the man who broke into the car was not an employee or ex-employee, Dillon's policy would cover the loss. The language of the exclusion does not necessarily mean that ""family or employee"" must refer to people who currently live with Dillon or work for him. For example, the word ""employee"" can refer to a former employee, as the exclusion explicitly states. Furthermore, the phrase ""member of your family or household"" could be used to refer to someone who was a member of Dillon's household in the past.

Explanation: Because of the plain meaning of the word ""family,"" the court would rule in Dillon's favor.

Considering just how the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Cooper covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes

The final answer is: Yes
This problem follows the plain meaning rule and does not consider any extrinsic evidence or interpretations from any other rules.  The ordinary meaning of the word ""tracking device"" is something that tracks something.  A GPS device does track something (the car), and is therefore covered.  There is no requirement that the device must also report its findings to someone.  The policy language is unambiguous, and a court would not look beyond the language of the policy.  Therefore, Cooper is covered by the insurance.  Answer is Yes. (Note:  This is a very difficult question.  The ordinary meaning of the word """,-166.4620221,-5.655338287,-5.295963287,-65504,-65504

The final answer is: Yes
If you want to make sure you get this problem correct, you should be able to articulate a reason why Cooper is covered, and here it is: The phrase ""GPS tracking device"" is a term of art that refers to a device which sends location information to a central server. Thus, the ordinary speaker would understand it to mean any GPS device that sends information to a central server, as long as it was designed to do so. A GPS device with a passive receiver that does not send any information to a central server is not a GPS tracking device, even if it displays a map.

Considering just how the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Cooper covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes

The final answer is: Yes
This problem follows the plain meaning rule and does not consider any extrinsic evidence or interpretations from any legal or technical fields. An ordinary speaker of English would take the GPS-tracking device to be a device that is intended to track a vehicle, which Cooper's smartphone is. Thus, the policy's language should be interpreted to include Cooper's smartphone. Therefore, Cooper is covered by the insurance policy. 
Answer: Yes. (In fact, the majority of the jurisdictions that have addressed this issue would hold the same way, although a few minority jurisdictions would hold that the GPS tracking device must be specifically designed to track",-177.0359995,-6.14320612,-5.69008112,-65504,-65504

Considering just how the word ""broken glass"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Ahmad covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the plain meaning of the phrase ""broken glass"", and because a scratch in the glass counts as broken, Ahmad is covered by the policy. [Garner's Dictionary of Legal Usage 142-45 (3d ed. 2011)] (Note: This is an exercise in the plain meaning rule, which states that words and phrases in a contract should be interpreted according to their ordinary, non-technical meaning. It is not a case about how much damage or when the damage occurred, but about what the words mean.)

While his car is parked in the lot, a baseball from a nearby little league game hits his car's front windshield. When he returns, he discovers the baseball on his windshield, which has been shattered beyond repair. Ahmad files a claim with his insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""broken glass"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Ahmad covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes.
It is possible to argue, in an adversarial context, that Ahmad's policy would only cover cases where the glass was broken by an external force (as opposed to a force that was already inside the car). However, this is an implausible interpretation of ""broken glass."" For most speakers of English, the phrase would naturally be understood as including any case where the glass is broken, regardless of how it was broken. Although the insurance company's interpretation might be more plausible, it would require an understanding of the specific usage of this phrase in insurance contexts, which is not part of the ordinary meaning",-168.343387,-5.610274315,-5.336836815,-65504,-65504

Considering just how the word ""broken glass"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Ahmad covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes
Key Issue: Reasonable Expectations Doctrine
The case of Ahmad's car insurance policy involves the issue of how the word ""broken glass"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English. The court would apply the Reasonable Expectations Doctrine.
The Reasonable Expectations Doctrine states that insurance policies will be construed in accordance with the reasonable expectations of the average buyer, based on the usual and customary language of the policy. This means that if a term is ambiguous or unclear, the court will resolve the ambiguity in favor of the insured, and give the term a meaning",-106.5410177,-5.53331089,-5.85362339,-65504,-65504

Considering just how the word ""glass"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Aneesh covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: A is correct. The damage was ""solely and directly caused by broken glass,"" even though the baseball was the direct cause of the damage to the hood. The relevant ""broken glass"" is the baseball. A baseball is a type of hard, brittle object which, when it breaks, shatters into pieces. Therefore, ""broken glass"" would be understood to include a baseball. The policy language is unambiguous, but common usage supports this interpretation as well.

Explanation: Aneesh's car insurance policy covers ""Vehicle Glass"" damage. The term ""glass"" is understood by ordinary speakers of English to include the windshield of a car.

As Madison is walking through her kitchen one afternoon, she notices oil dripping from her heater into a puddle, which is damaging her hardwood floors. Madison files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""leaking "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Madison covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes
It is possible to argue, on one hand, that ""leaking"" does not entail movement or escape from a container, but rather merely an outflow of a liquid.
On the other hand, in ordinary usage, ""leak"" usually implies an unwanted or unintentional escape or movement of a substance. Since the oil is leaving the fixed installation, it is reasonable to interpret ""leaking"" as ""escaping.""
So Madison is covered under the insurance policy. 
Answer: YES.  Finally, it is also worth noting that if the word ""leaking"" meant something different than its ordinary meaning, then it would likely be modified to make that clear.  So, if the word meant something other than ""escape"", then it might be written """,-227.9112465,-4.668088913,-4.535276413,-65504,-65504

It is likely that an ordinary speaker of English would take ""malicious people"" to include animals that act with malicious intent, such as a dog that tramples a person's plants out of spite or with intent to cause harm.

It is likely that the word ""malicious"" has a subjective connotation and a descriptive one. Therefore, the sentence should be understood as covering vandalism even if it is unintentionally caused by someone. The person who trampled the plants probably intended to cause harm, even if only to scare people. Most people would likely use the word ""malicious"" to describe an act that is intended to cause harm. Therefore, as long as the act was intended to cause harm, it would be considered ""malicious.""

Explanation: Because of the word ""professional,"" one might initially assume that only companies or organizations would qualify as ""professional movers,"" thus excluding individuals. However, this reasoning is too narrow. In common usage, ""professional"" refers to an individual who makes a living in a particular field or industry, not just organizations.

The correct answer is Yes.  The word ""professional movers"" is used to indicate the type of moving company, not the type of people moving the furniture. Therefore, if Denise hires professional movers, the insurance covers damage to her belongings during the move.

Identity Theft II,no_or_yes,"Jack has insurance coverage against loss and damage from ""Identity Theft,"" which excludes ""identity theft connected with the policyholder's occupation.""
Jack is a successful business consultant. One day, while Jack is at home, hackers manage to infiltrate the computer network at Jack's office. The hackers steal Jack's credit card information and make a number of fraudulent purchases in his name. To resolve the fraud, Jack must spend thousands of dollars in legal fees. Jack files a claim with his insurance company for his losses. 
Considering just how the word ""connected with occupation"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Jack covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: This question tests understanding of how the phrase ""connected with the policyholder's occupation"" is used in insurance policy language. If Jack were a janitor and a thief stole his credit card, no one would say that the theft was ""connected with his occupation."" Thus, the phrase is used to indicate something very different -- an ""occupation-related"" risk, as opposed to a risk that would face anyone. Since Jack's occupation as a consultant has created an opportunity for hackers to steal his credit card, the risk that his occupation has created is the risk that the policy excludes.",-149.452132,-6.101953983,-6.539453983,-65504,-65504

Jack files a claim with his insurance company for his losses. 
Considering just how the word ""connected with occupation"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Jack covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: This question tests understanding of how the phrase ""connected with the policyholder's occupation"" is used in insurance policy language. If Jack were a bank teller and the identity theft were connected with his job (e.g. he was robbed at gunpoint in his bank), then he would not be covered. But Jack is a business consultant. How would the word ""connected with"" be understood by ordinary speakers of English? It would mean ""caused by, related to, or due to"" his occupation.

Jack is a successful business consultant. One day, while Jack is at home, hackers manage to infiltrate the computer network of an upscale restaurant where Jack and his colleagues frequently conduct meetings.

Considering just how the word ""connected with occupation"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Jack covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes
Explanation: This question tests understanding of the exclusion clause and how it would be understood by ordinary speakers of English. Although Jack's occupation may have contributed to the risk of theft, the actual event of theft is not ""connected with his occupation."" The exclusion does not apply. Thus, Jack is covered. 
The best answer is Y.  The correct answer is Y because the exclusion only applies to identity theft connected with the policyholder's occupation.  Jack's occupation was merely a contributing factor to the theft, not the theft itself.  The",-120.7118002,-6.092132568,-6.639007568,-65504,-65504

Vivian lives alone in a single-family house in the suburbs. She decides to permanently move abroad, but she keeps the deed to her house so that her children can inherit it one day. While abroad, her house suffers from an electrical short circuit that causes a severe fire, damaging nearly the entire home. Vivian files a claim with her insurance company for the damages. 
Considering just how the word ""temporarily removed"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Vivian covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Words and phrases such as ""temporarily"" are understood in common usage to be relative to the specific situation. In this case, Vivian's permanent removal from the house is still temporary, relative to the long-term use of the house. Most people would not consider someone who is away for several years to be ""permanently"" removed from their home. The word ""temporarily"" is interpreted in the context of the common usage of the term, and Vivian would be considered covered.

Considering just how the word ""temporarily removed"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Vivian covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: This question tests understanding of the word ""temporarily."" This word does not mean ""permanently,"" but rather ""for a short period of time."" Thus, Vivian's house would be covered while she was abroad, even if that was a permanent move. The insurance company would probably try to weasel out of paying, but the insurance policy is clear. Therefore, the final answer is ""Yes.""  Answer option C is correct.  The phrase ""temporarily away from home"" is not ambiguous.

Explanation: This question tests understanding of the word ""temporarily."" This word does not mean ""permanently,"" but rather ""for a short period of time."" Thus, Vivian's decision to keep the house and return one day means that she was not ""temporarily removed"" from the house. This situation would be quite difficult for the average person to understand because the word ""temporarily"" is so often used in a way that suggests permanence (e.g., ""I'm temporarily laid off,"" which means that one has been laid off permanently until",-130.1621007,-5.24709034,-5.36427784,-65504,-65504

It is possible to argue that Olivia's claim should be denied because the driver of the garbage truck did not intend to damage Olivia's property. That is, the accident was unintentional, and thus not a ""malicious act.""
This is a good example of how the word ""deliberate"" can be used in a way that is different from how it is typically understood. In ordinary usage, if someone accidentally breaks something, it is still deliberate in the sense that the person intended to break the object, not that the person wanted to.

It is possible to argue, in an adversarial case, that the teens did not act with the intent to cause destruction or damage. This might be the case if, for example, the teens were acting under duress, or if they intended to cause a reaction (e.g., anger, embarrassment) rather than damage per se.

It is possible to argue, in my opinion, that the teenagers' reckless behavior, driving at almost double the speed limit and crashing into garbage, shows a lack of deliberate consideration of the consequences of their actions.

Explanation: A third party, in common parlance, is someone who is not a party to a transaction or agreement.

Explanation: Because of the word ""traveling in,"" Gwen is covered by her insurance policy because she was in the process of moving her groceries from the parking lot to her car when she injured her wrist.

Explanation: Because of the word ""traveling in,"" Gwen is covered by her insurance policy because she was in the process of moving her SUV from one place to another, which would be understood by ordinary speakers of English to be ""traveling in."" However, the word ""traveling in"" has to be examined in the context of the sentence.

Explanation: Because of the way the word ""reasonable"" is used in common English, the requirement that the insured take ""reasonable steps"" to prevent the damage means that the insured must take such steps as an ordinary, prudent person in the same circumstances would take.

Wind Damage,no_or_yes,"Tom's home insurance policy includes coverage for ""Wind Damage,"" defined as ""damage from wind speeds with gusts of at least 55 mph.""
Tom's house is located near a large lake. One day, strong winds in excess of 55mph blow across the lake while Tom is working on his roof, but it's a loud and surprising ring from his cell phone that causes him to drop his heavy toolbox and thereby damage the roof. Tom files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""causative ""from"""" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Tom covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: This question tests understanding of the definition of cause, in particular the relationship between causation and the events or conditions that are part of the cause. The wind and the ring from the cell phone are both necessary conditions for Tom dropping the toolbox, which in turn caused the damage to the roof. Most people would say that the wind ""caused"" Tom to drop the toolbox, and thus would say that the wind ""caused"" the damage to the roof. 
Thus, even though the wind speed did not exceed 55 mph at the moment of damage, the wind",-136.4816408,-4.67752409,-4.38846159,-65504,-65504
Wind Damage,no_or_yes,"Tom's home insurance policy includes coverage for ""Wind Damage,"" defined as ""damage from wind speeds with gusts of at least 55 mph.""
Tom's house is located near a large lake. One day, strong winds in excess of 55mph blow across the lake and towards Tom's house, damaging the roof. Tom files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""causative ""from"""" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Tom covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the word ""from,"" one might initially assume that the policy would only cover damage caused by winds with gusts of at least 55 mph that directly hit the house. But the word ""from"" should be understood more broadly, as ""causative 'from.'"" In other words, the damage was caused by the wind, even if the wind did not directly hit the house. The fact that the wind blew ""from"" the lake to Tom's house is sufficient to show that it was the wind that caused the damage. Thus, Tom is covered by the policy. 
This usage of ""from"" can be illustrated by the following sentence: ""The house was damaged by",-124.1574108,-4.539603233,-4.641165733,-65504,-65504
Wind Damage,no_or_yes,"Tom's home insurance policy includes coverage for ""Wind Damage,"" defined as ""damage from wind speeds with gusts of at least 55 mph.""
Tom's house is located near a large lake. One day, strong winds in excess of 55mph blow across the lake, causing waves to crash into Tom's house and thereby damaging the roof. Tom files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""causative ""from"""" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Tom covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the word ""from,"" one might initially assume that only damage directly caused by the wind (wind-driven rain, for example) would be covered. But the word ""from"" can also mean ""originating in"" or ""resulting from."" So damage to the house that originates in the wind but is caused by the waves would still be covered. The word ""from"" is not being used in its spatial sense (damage originating from a particular location) but rather in its causal sense.

Storm Damage,no_or_yes,"Cam's home insurance policy includes coverage for ""Storm Damage,"" defined as ""damage caused by a storm.""
One day, a lightning storm passes through Cam's neighborhood and lightning hits his neighborhood's power plant, causing a power outage. Cam goes to his attic with a candle to reset the circuit breaker, but he drops the candle and starts a fire so large that almost all of his roof burns before firefighters manage to extinguish it. Cam files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""cause"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Cam covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the idea that an effect can have more than one cause, a but-for test is not sufficient to determine coverage. The courts therefore look to see if the damage was a direct result of the storm. If it was, then the damage was covered even though the fire was an intervening force. Since the fire would not have occurred but for the power outage, which would not have occurred but for the storm, the court would find that the storm was a cause of the fire. So Cam is covered.  Answer Yes. \backslash

One day, a lightning storm passes through Cam's neighborhood and lightning hits his roof, causing a fire. Almost all of his roof burns before firefighters manage to extinguish it. Cam files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""cause"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Cam covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Words and phrases such as ""cause"" have a ""dictionary meaning"" and a ""legal meaning."" Although dictionary definitions are not conclusive, they may provide guidance on the meaning of a term. The dictionary definition of ""cause"" is to ""make or bring about (something) by an action or set of circumstances."" In this case, Cam would probably understand the word to mean a direct action, and the storm would have caused the damage. Legal definitions may differ, but only if the contract language clearly indicates that the term has a special meaning. Here, the term is not defined in the policy, and it is unlikely that the parties would have understood the term to mean ""contribute to."" Therefore, Cam is covered under the policy.

One day, a lightning storm passes through Cam's neighborhood and lightning hits his street's power line, causing a power surge. The power surge causes the space heater in Cam's attic to catch fire, and almost all of his roof burns before firefighters manage to extinguish it. Cam files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""cause"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Cam covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the idea that one event can cause another in a series of events, Cam is covered by the policy. ""Cause"" is understood to imply a causal chain of events. The policy covers damage caused by a storm, and the power surge was caused by lightning, which was itself a part of the storm. Therefore, Cam is covered by the policy. The word ""cause"" would not be understood to require a direct causal relationship. Thus, the requirement that ""the fire be the result of lightning"" would be satisfied if the fire was the result of a power surge caused by lightning.

Hail Damage,no_or_yes,"Rick's home insurance policy includes coverage for ""Hail Damage,"" defined as ""damage from hail of such intensity that it causes damage to hard surfaces or breaks glass.""
One day, a hail storm hits Rick's house and causes damage to the plants on his balcony. Many plants lose leaves and some are completely covered in ice, causing them to die. Rick files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""hard surface"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Rick covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Words and phrases such as ""hard surface"" are understood in common usage to be elliptical, with the ellipsis being understood to refer to the context in which the word or phrase is used. So ""hard surface"" would be understood to mean ""a hard surface of a house."" This interpretation is also supported by the fact that the policy includes a clause for ""Breakage of Glass."" An interpretation that leads to the conclusion that ""hard surface"" includes plants would be inconsistent with the inclusion of that clause, since plants are not typically associated with breakage of glass. Therefore, the ordinary meaning of ""hard surface"" does not include plants, and thus Rick is covered by",-153.2623167,-4.947876453,-4.565063953,-65504,-65504

One day, a hail storm hits Rick's house and causes damage to his roof's clay shingles. Many shingles are chipped and some even develop large cracks, causing the roof to leak. Rick files a claim with his insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""hard surface"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Rick covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes
It is likely that Rick is covered. The phrase ""hard surface"" would be understood to include hard surfaces that are not rigid, such as clay shingles, and other materials that are not glass. The definition is not exclusive, but rather a non-exclusive example of the types of things that would be covered. Other surfaces that are not ""hard"" in the sense that they are rigid, but rather hard in the sense that they are resistant to scratching or abrasion, would also be included. For example, if Rick had a roof made of tile, he would be covered for hail damage to those as well. (It is worth noting that the word ""hail""",-160.2994704,-4.837645531,-4.728270531,-65504,-65504

Explanation: Words and phrases such as ""hard surface"" are understood in common usage to be elliptical, with the ellipsis being understood to refer to the context in which the word or phrase is used. So ""hard surface"" would be understood to mean ""a hard surface of a house."" This interpretation is also supported by the fact that the policy includes a clause for ""Breakage of Glass."" An interpretation that leads to the conclusion that ""hard surface"" means ""a hard surface of a house"" is not absurd. It is not strained or far-fetched. It is not a flight of fancy.

Ground Heave I,no_or_yes,"Blake has home insurance that covers ""Ground Heave"" damage, defined as ""loss or damage resulting from ground heave of the site on which the building stands, or landslip.""
One evening, several of Blake's friends crowd into his house for a dance party. The many rambunctious dancers cause Blake's house to shake, which damages the house's foundation. Blake files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Blake covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the word ""ground"" in the definition of ""ground heave,"" one might initially be inclined to believe that Blake is not covered. But the definition also includes ""landslip."" The term ""ground heave"" is intended to cover damage resulting from any movement of the earth. Thus, the damage was within the policy's scope. Moreover, because the word ""ground"" is not qualified by any limiting language (like ""natural"" or ""artificial""), it is most reasonable to construe it to include the earth's surface, as well as the earth itself.

Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Blake covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the way the word ""ground heave"" is defined, a common understanding of the term is likely to be more relevant than the dictionary definition. In this case, ""ground heave"" is commonly understood as an upward movement of the ground, such as when water freezes underneath. In the situation presented, the ground ""heaved"" upward, even if it wasn't caused by water. Therefore, Blake would be covered under the insurance policy.

*ground heave* refers to an upward movement of the ground (as might occur in response to the mining or tunneling activities of an underground cave-in, or other geological event). The phrase would not be used to describe a phenomenon caused by a collision of vehicles on the surface.
(And it doesn't matter whether the crash causes ""ground heave"" in the sense that it causes the ground to heave, or whether it causes ""ground heave"" in the sense that it causes the house to heave on its foundation - since the policy covers damage to the house itself, Blake will be able to collect on the claim)Newer word combinations -",-217.7382931,-5.177988529,-4.474863529,-65504,-65504

One day, Clint hears a loud crash in his house and finds that his roof has partly caved in due to water damage. Clint files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Clint covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: This question tests understanding of ordinary language. The definition of ""ground heave"" uses the word ""resulting from"", which implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the ground heaving and the damage. However, in this case, the damage was not due to the ground heaving, but to the water damage. A more accurate definition would have been ""damage caused by ground heaving."" An insurance company would have interpreted ""ground heave"" in this way, and would have honored the claim. The ordinary speaker of English would have interpreted the term as referring to the physical process of the ground heaving, rather than the effect of the ground heaving. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Clint covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Words and phrases in a policy of insurance have to be interpreted in the light of the ordinary meaning of the words in the English language, unless the ordinary meaning is absurd or would result in an interpretation that is unreasonable. If the ordinary meaning of ""ground heave"" is understood to include a landslip, then it would be reasonable to interpret it to include any kind of movement of the ground, and hence the crack in the house's foundation would be covered.

Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Clint covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes
Explanation: This question tests understanding of ordinary language. The definition of ""ground heave"" uses the word ""ground"" in a way that is somewhat ambiguous, but a reasonable speaker of English would interpret it as referring to upward movement of the ground, rather than any other kind of movement. Since a tree falling on the roof is likely to cause the ground to shift or ""heave"" downward, it is possible that Clint will be covered under this policy. 
Note: This is a trick question. Most people will initially say ""no"" but the correct answer is ""yes"". It is a play on words and requires some creative thinking to understand the meaning.

Considering just how the word ""necessary and reasonable"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Justin covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: This question tests understanding of Ordinary Language Philosophy, specifically of the concept of a ""ceteris paribus"" clause, and how it can affect ordinary language interpretation.
In this case, the phrase ""necessary and reasonable costs"" is a ""ceteris paribus"" clause. In ordinary language, we would use the phrase ""necessary and reasonable"" to mean ""the minimum required to accomplish the task."" Thus, any costs above that are not ""necessary and reasonable"" would be considered excessive.

Considering just how the word ""necessary and reasonable"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Justin covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes
It is possible to argue that the damage to the drywall and floorboards was a necessary and reasonable part of locating and fixing the accidental damage to the pipe, and therefore that the policy would cover the costs of repairing this damage. This is because the drywall and floorboards were damaged while Justin was repairing the pipe, and the damage was probably caused by Justin's reasonable efforts to access and repair the pipe. Therefore, it would be a fair interpretation of the policy to cover this damage.

It is possible to argue that the damage caused by Justin was ""reasonable"", since a plumber would need to be able to access the pipe. However, the damage may not be ""necessary"" since, with more caution, he could have avoided it. However, in this case, the answer is ""Yes"" because the use of ""necessary and reasonable"" would be understood as conjunctive, rather than disjunctive.

Most people would say that Jenny is covered, because custody or control does not require actual possession of the car.

John takes generally good care of his car, but over the years he has noticed a gradual buildup of rust on his front left wheel. He brings the car to a mechanic to have the wheel replaced. John files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""wear and tear"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is John covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Words and phrases such as ""wear and tear,"" ""normal use,"" and ""neglect"" are used to limit coverage. The courts have defined these phrases in the context of insurance policies, and they are generally interpreted in favor of the insured. ""Wear and tear"" is understood to refer to the gradual deterioration of an item due to its use, as opposed to damage caused by an unusual or unexpected event. In this case, the buildup of rust on John's front left wheel was a gradual process that occurred over time, and therefore, it can be said to be a result of wear and tear. Therefore, the insurance policy would cover the cost of replacing the wheel. , , , ,",-138.2424891,-5.010181427,-5.377368927,-65504,-65504
Vehicle Damage II,no_or_yes,"John's car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Damage,"" which excludes ""loss or damage caused by wear and tear.""
John takes generally good care of his car, but one day he is involved in a minor accident which damages his front left wheel. He brings the car to a mechanic to have the wheel replaced. John files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""wear and tear"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is John covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: This question requires understanding of the concept of wear and tear. This concept is often understood to mean damage or deterioration caused by repeated use, which may be small and gradual but cumulative. In this case, the accident was a minor incident that caused a sudden and immediate damage to the car, rather than the result of a long period of use. Thus, the damage is not caused by wear and tear. Therefore, John is covered by his insurance policy.

John takes generally good care of his car, but one day he is involved in a minor accident which knocks his front left wheel out of alignment. He brings his car in to a mechanic to have the wheel re-aligned, but the mechanic tells John that his car will also need substantial repair work because the unaligned wheel has been scraping against the body of the car since the accident. John files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""wear and tear"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is John covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes
Explanation: This question requires us to use our understanding of how ordinary speakers of English would understand the word ""wear and tear"" in this context. John's car was damaged in a minor accident. This is clearly not ""wear and tear,"" which would mean damage due to normal, everyday use of the car. Rather, it is damage due to an accident, which is a sudden, external event rather than a result of John's ordinary use of the car.

Considering just how the word ""accessory"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Steve covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the word ""accessory"" in the policy, and because a guitar can be regarded as an accessory to a car, Steve is covered.  The policy would not be interpreted as covering only items attached to the car.
The word ""attached"" is a clue to the fact that the answer is ""Yes"". The policy would be interpreted as covering items that are not attached to the car. For example, a guitar case that was in the car, but not attached to the car, would be covered.

One day, Steve is involved in a minor accident. His GPS navigation system, which was in the car at the time, was damaged. Steve files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""accessory"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Steve covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the broad meaning of ""accessory,"" in this case, a navigation system is regarded as an accessory to a car. 
The clause, ""while in or on the car,"" is clearly meant to narrow down the definition of accessories, so that it would only cover those accessories that are in the car at the time of the accident. Therefore, because the GPS navigation system was in the car, the damage to it is covered. 
In this case, ""accessory"" is used in a broad sense, and it is defined to include a wide variety of things (e.g. phone, antenna, antenna ball) that one might install in their car.",-183.769824,-4.36938715,-4.93188715,-65504,-65504

Considering just how the word ""accessory"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Steve covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the broad meaning of ""accessory,"" in this case, a tablet computer qualifies as an ""accessory."" If the insurance company were to limit the term ""accessory"" to things like a bumper or a wheel, that limitation would be a strained or unnatural interpretation. In that case, we would not expect the policy to be enforceable, because the limitation would be contrary to the parties' reasonable understanding of the terms. [UCC § 1-205].  But here, the limitation to ""the car"" or ""car accessories"" does not strain or distort the meaning of ""accessory.""  It just provides an",-175.3181492,-4.59503603,-5.22784853,-65504,-65504

Explanation: Because of the broad meaning of ""audio equipment,"" in ordinary English, a laptop would be regarded as a kind of ""audio equipment.""

Considering just how the word ""audio equipment"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Chris covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the broad meaning of ""audio equipment,"" Chris's stereo system and speakers are clearly within the category of equipment ""while in the car."" The language of the policy is unambiguous, and therefore there is no need for an ordinary speaker of English to engage in any further interpretation of the policy. 
Answer Yes is correct because the policyholder would understand that ""audio equipment"" refers to all equipment that is part of the car's audio system, including speakers, cd players, and stereos. The ordinary speaker of English would not draw any distinction between the car and the equipment, and would expect that both would be included in the policy.

The policy defines ""Vehicle Damage"" as ""loss or damage to the policy holder's 1) car; or 2) audio equipment (while in the car).""
Step 2: Determine how the term ""audio equipment"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English.
In everyday language, ""audio equipment"" would typically refer to electronic devices that produce or reproduce sound, such as speakers, headphones, or stereos.

Explanation: This question tests understanding of how the word ""damage"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English. Although James' child's car seat was stolen, not damaged, the policy uses the word ""damage"" in a way that ordinary people would interpret as including loss.

Explanation: This question tests understanding of how the word ""damage"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English.

Considering just how the word ""audio equipment"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Gisele covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the word ""audio,"" one might initially assume that only sound-related equipment would be covered (e.g., a car stereo). But the ordinary meaning of the word ""equipment"" includes computers and other electronic devices. Moreover, the word ""audio"" is modifying ""equipment,"" not vice versa.

It is possible to argue that the word ""audio equipment"" in the policy does not include a car stereo because stereo systems are not what most people would consider to be ""equipment."" Yet, the only equipment that is attached to a car is the sound equipment, such as radios, speakers and CD players. So we would use the ordinary speaker's understanding of ""equipment"" in this case and thus Gisele would be covered.

Explanation: Words and phrases such as ""audio equipment"" are understood in common usage to include any sort of equipment or device used in connection with sound.

It is possible to argue that the damage was due to a fire - and this is the reason that the car insurance company ultimately ended up paying Ken for the damage. The policy would not have been issued if they had intended that there would be no payment if a cigarette caused damage to the car, even though the cigarette did not ignite.

Explanation: Because of the broad meaning of ""fire"" in ordinary usage, this is probably covered.

Explanation: Hunter is covered by the insurance. A car accessory is defined as an item attached to or used with the car, such as a CD player or a spare tire. A large sum of money is something that would be left inside a car, which means that it would be understood by ordinary speakers of English as an accessory. Thus, the policy would cover the loss.

Step 1: Analyze the policy exclusion clause to understand its scope and application.
The policy exclusion clause excludes coverage for loss or damage caused by theft or attempted theft if the car was taken by a member of the policyholder's family or household, or taken by an employee or ex-employee. However, the key phrase is ""member of your family or household."" The exclusion specifically uses the word ""member,"" which suggests a direct relationship such as a spouse, parent, child, or sibling.

Step 1: Analyze the policy exclusion clause to understand its scope and application.
The policy exclusion clause excludes coverage for loss or damage caused by theft or attempted theft if the car was taken by a member of the policyholder's family or household, or by an employee or ex-employee.

Step 2: Determine the meaning of ""family or household"" in the context of the policy.
In ordinary language, ""family or household"" typically refers to individuals related by blood or marriage, or who reside with the policyholder, such as roommates or domestic partners. It does not necessarily imply a close or",-60.2535495,-4.784070492,-4.815320492,-65504,-65504

Considering just how the word ""family or employee"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Dillon covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the plain meaning of the terms, a reasonable insured would believe the exclusion applies to the following groups: (i) members of the policyholder's immediate family (e.g., spouse, children, parents) (ii) people living in the policyholder's house (e.g., step-families, roommates, boarders); and (iii) the policyholder's employers and their employees. Since Dillon's estranged wife does not fall within these categories, the exclusion would not apply.

Cooper, who doesn't keep a GPS tracking device in his car, goes on vacation and leaves his car in his home garage. However, surveillance footage captures a masked assailant breaking into his car and driving away. Cooper files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
Considering just how the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Cooper covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the word ""tracking device"", the average person would think of a device that tracks the car's location, not a device that prevents the car from being stolen. The policy doesn't require the device to be operational when the car is stolen, just that it be present. Since it was present, even if it wasn't working, Cooper would be covered. Therefore, the final answer is Yes.  Although this is a very weak reading of the policy, it is the most reasonable interpretation. The other answer, No, is not reasonable because if the average person is to understand the word ""tracking device"" as a device that prevents the car from",-159.3845688,-4.644218922,-4.222343922,-65504,-65504

Considering just how the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Cooper covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes
Step 1:  The policy stipulates that coverage for ""Vehicle Theft"" is only applicable if the policyholder's car contains a working GPS tracking device. 
Step 2:  To determine whether Cooper is covered under this policy, we need to consider how the term ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English.
Step 3:  A GPS tracking device is typically considered a type of tracking device, but it's essential to consider the context in which the term is used in the policy.

Considering just how the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Cooper covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes
Step 1: Analyze the policy's language to understand the scope of coverage.
The policy specifies that coverage for ""Vehicle Theft"" applies only if the policyholder's car contains a working GPS tracking device. This language is specific and indicates that the GPS device must be a separate, stand-alone device installed in the vehicle.

Step 2: Determine how ordinary speakers of English would interpret the word ""tracking device.""
The word ""tracking device"" is commonly understood to refer to a device that can track the location of an object, such as a vehicle, in real-time. This understanding is supported by dictionaries and common usage.

Considering just how the word ""broken glass"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Ahmad covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes
Explanation: Because of the plain meaning of the phrase ""broken glass"", and because a scratch in the glass counts as broken, Ahmad is covered by the policy. [The policy would not be interpreted as covering only complete shattering of the glass.] AnswerNo is incorrect.

*   **Policy Definition:** The policy defines ""Vehicle Glass"" as ""broken glass in the car's windows or windshield."" This suggests that the policy covers damage to glass that is already broken.

Ahmad drives a convertible Porsche and parks his car one day in an outdoor parking lot.

Explanation: Because of the plain meaning of the word ""broken,"" Ahmad's policy would cover the damage to his car's windshield, even though it is still intact and functioning.
This is a classic example of an ""everyday object"" problem, in which a word is defined with reference to an object or situation with which the listener is familiar, but the policy is applied in an unusual way.

Explanation: A is correct. The policy defines ""Vehicle Glass"" as ""broken glass, and any scratching to the bodywork caused solely and directly by broken glass."" The damage to the hood was caused solely and directly by broken glass (the baseball), so Aneesh is covered by his policy. Most people would define the word ""glass"" to include baseballs. The word ""glass"" would not be understood to refer to objects made of glass but not containing glass, such as baseballs.

Explanation: A is correct. The policy defines ""Vehicle Glass"" as ""broken glass, and any scratching to the bodywork caused solely and directly by broken glass."" The damage to the car's bodywork occurred directly and solely as a result of the breaking of the car's windshield, so the policy covers the damage.

It's possible to argue that the garbage truck driver was not in control and was a victim of circumstances, but the word ""deliberate"" can be understood to refer to the intention of the actor, and the driver was probably intended to do something that was not harmful.

*ground heave* is a geological phenomenon that occurs when water from ice melting or groundwater expansion causes the ground to rise. It is a bit of a colloquialism that refers to the ground suddenly rising up. If we look at the word ""ground heave"" as understood by ordinary speakers of English, we can see that ""ground heave"" is referring to an up movement of the ground.

It is possible to imagine, in an idealized case, that the roof might collapse in because of the ground heave, if there were an underground cavern which collapsed and the ground above were heaved upwards.

It is possible to argue, on one hand, that ""ground heave"" is something where the ground rises or shifts upwards, and since Clint's house shifted downwards, the damage is not covered. However, the phrase is not typically understood that way. Typically, ""heave"" is understood as to suddenly move or shift, usually without warning.  Therefore, even if the ground moved down rather than up, the damage would still be covered. 

In fact, the example provided with the question shows that the ground moved, and that is enough to indicate that it ""heaved"".  The direction of the movement is irrelevant. Therefore",-188.05417,-4.970965862,-5.447528362,-65504,-65504

It is clear that Clint's home insurance would cover his claim in this case because a falling tree is the result of ground movement, specifically a landslide (or landslip) which would be covered under the policy. Therefore, the answer is yes. 

Note: This is a classic example of an ambiguous term in the law. A term is ambiguous if it can be reasonably interpreted in more than one way.  In this case, the term ""ground heave"" can reasonably be interpreted as not only covering damage from ground that is moving upward, but also from ground that is moving downward (ie. a landslide).

## Step 1: Understand the concept of ""wear and tear"" in the context of vehicle maintenance.
""Wear and tear"" typically refers to the gradual deterioration of a vehicle's parts due to normal use and aging, such as worn-out brake pads, faded paint, or cracked dashboards.

## Step 2: Consider the nature of the damage John's car sustained in the accident.
John's car was involved in a minor accident, which damaged his front left wheel. This incident is an external event that caused damage to the vehicle, rather than a gradual deterioration due to normal use or aging.

It is possible to imagine cases in which a court might rule in favor of the insurance company, based on a strict reading of ""wear and tear"" as any kind of damage that occurs over time.

It is possible to imagine a flood caused by a rapid build-up from outside the buildings in the sense that the water flows from a pond into a building through a small hole.

It is generally understood in English that ""malicious"" refers to intent or intent to cause harm to another person or their property, and that ""vandals"" refer to people who intentionally cause damage to property for their own pleasure or gratification.

It is possible to argue that the persons who trampled Margot's plants are vandals in the sense that they are ""people who commit acts of vandalism.""  However, this would not be the ordinary usage.  The term ""vandal"" was originally applied to the tribe of people who sacked Rome in the 5th century, known for their destructive and wanton acts of violence.

It is possible to argue that the childrens' trampling of the plants was a malicious act, in that they did not have permission to do so and, presumably, they would not have wanted Margot to know that they were doing it.

It is possible to imagine cases in which a building has been damaged by ground heave (e.g., where the ground has ""heaved"" up and into a hole in the roof). But the phrase ""ground heave"" would more commonly be used to refer to damage to a building due to its foundation being displaced by the swelling of the ground.

It is possible to imagine a case in which a tree falling on a house might be described as a ""ground heave"" in a very loose sense of the word, but that is not how the word would be understood by ordinary speakers of English.

Escape of Oil I,disagreement,"Madison has insurance that covers home damage from ""Escape of Oil,"" defined as ""oil leaking from a fixed oil-fired heating installation.""

It's possible to argue that Madison's spill of kerosene oil on her hardwood floors would be regarded as an ""escape"" of oil, which would make her situation covered by the policy. However, if one takes a more literal interpretation of the word ""leaking,"" then Madison's situation wouldn't be covered by the insurance because ""leaking"" would imply an unintended, long-term release of oil from a fixed installation.

It's possible to imagine cases in which a heater might leak in a way that would be understood to mean that the oil isn't escaping. Consider, for example, a case in which the oil is being stored in a tank that is equipped with a leak-detecting device, and the device has just detected a very small leak. In such a case, the oil isn't escaping from the heater, and hence the insurance policy wouldn't cover the damage.

It seems that the word ""heating installation"" would be understood as only referring to the heater itself, not the piping and fittings.

## Step 1: Understand the definition of ""heating installation"" in the context of the insurance policy.
The policy defines ""heating installation"" as something that is ""fixed"" and related to oil-fired heating. This suggests a more complex setup than a simple lamp.

## Step 2: Consider the common understanding of ""heating installation"" in everyday language.

## Step 2: Analyze the situation described in the scenario.

It is likely that Vivian is not covered by the insurance because she is not temporarily away from home.

She is not likely to be considered ""temporarily away"" given her extended absence from her house. An insurance company would likely have the same interpretation. Therefore, Vivian is not covered.

The doctor informs her that after the accident, she will regain full functionality in her left knee if she commits to expensive physical therapy for three months.

It's possible to argue that a plant is a hard surface in the sense that a hammer can be used to hit it, but this is an uncommon way of understanding the term. Hard surfaces are typically things you can walk on, like a floor, or things you can touch with your hand, like a wall. A plant is not something you can walk on, and it's not something you can touch with your hand in the usual sense.

Explanation: This question requires understanding the concept of ""wear and tear"" and how it would be interpreted by ordinary speakers of English. If one were to break down the words in the phrase, it would seem that ""wear and tear"" should refer to any damage that results from using the car, as ""wear"" would refer to physical damage and ""tear"" would refer to damage from use. However, in ordinary English usage, ""wear and tear"" typically means minor damage or deterioration that results from normal, everyday use of something, not damage that results from an accident or misuse.

    One day, Ken parks his car next to his home, and while he is out on a jog his neighbor's home catches fire. The fire spreads to Ken's car, which is subsequently destroyed in the blaze. Ken files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
    Considering just how the word ""fire damage"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Ken is covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes. I disagree. The word ""fire damage"" would not be understood as meaning damage to the car caused by fire from an external source. Rather, it would be understood to mean damage to the car caused by fire from an internal source, such as a defective engine or a mechanical failure. Thus, there was no coverage under the policy for damage to Ken's car caused by the external fire from his neighbor's home.

    One day, Ken parks his car next to his home and leaves behind his smartphone, which catches fire later that day due to a defect. The fire does not spread to the rest of the car, but it causes significant smoke damage to the car's interior. Ken files a claim with his insurance company for the damage.

It's possible to argue that the damage was due to a fire (the phone), but not to the car catching on fire, and therefore, Ken's insurance company may deny his claim. This problem is an example of a LEXICAL ambiguity, which occurs when a word has multiple meanings, and therefore the meaning of a sentence can change depending on how a word is interpreted.

    Hunter, who lives alone, goes on vacation and leaves his car in his home garage. However, surveillance footage captures a masked assailant breaking into his car and stealing several hundred dollars in bills that Hunter left in the car. Hunter files a claim with his insurance company for the loss.

The correct answer is: Yes. I disagree. 
    The term ""car accessories"" suggests objects that are designed to be attached to the car. This would exclude personal items like currency left inside the car. However, in everyday usage, people use the term to refer to personal items left in the car.  Therefore, an insurance policy that uses the term without further clarification may be interpreted in more than one way.

The correct answer is: Yes. I disagree. 
    The term ""accessories"" suggests an item which is designed to be worn or carried by the vehicle. So, in this case, seat covers can be considered as such. However, while the policy may cover the theft of seat covers, the policy would not cover the cost to replace the seat covers if they were merely damaged during the theft.

When interpreting the policy, it's essential to consider the ordinary meaning of the word ""tracking device."" The term is often used in everyday language to describe any device that enables the real-time monitoring of a vehicle's location. In this context, the policyholder would reasonably assume that a GPS tracking device meets the policy's requirements.

It seems that you might benefit from a more detailed explanation of the reasoning process. Here's one:

The term ""GPS tracking device"" typically connotes a standalone device that is specifically designed to track the location of a vehicle in real-time. While Cooper's GPS-tracked smartphone may be able to provide location information, it's not a standalone device that is specifically designed for vehicle tracking. Therefore, an ordinary speaker of English would not consider a smartphone to be a GPS tracking device for the purposes of this insurance policy.

It is possible to imagine cases in which a heater might leak in a way that would be covered by the policy, such as a pipe coming loose from the tank and oil dripping through the pipe. In this case, the heater itself would not be leaking, but there is a leak between the heater and the outside environment.

It is possible to argue that a flow of water is a sudden, unforeseen outflow of water, but such an interpretation would be unnatural. It is more natural to interpret the word ""flow"" as something that moves over a surface or from a source, such as a river or a stream.

It is possible to argue that a strike is a form of political disturbance and therefore a labor strike should be considered as a political disturbance.

It is possible to argue that a plant is a hard surface in the sense that a hammer can be used to hit it and it will not bend.

It is possible to argue that the damage was due to a ""ground heave"" in the sense that the ground did rise, but this is not the ordinary meaning of the word ""heave."" The word ""heave"" is more commonly associated with a sudden upward movement, such as when a weight is lifted or a ship is launched. For example, the word ""heave"" can be used in the phrase ""heave a heavy load."" In this context, ""heave"" means to raise or lift something upwards.

    Considering just how the word ""wear and tear"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, John is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes

Explanation: This question requires understanding the concept of ""wear and tear"" and how it would be interpreted by ordinary speakers of English. If a car is used, it will inevitably suffer from some wear and tear. Therefore, the damage would be considered a result of wear and tear, and John is not covered by the insurance. The correct answer is ""Yes,"" John is not covered by the insurance.

Answer: A
Reasoning: This question requires the application of the common law rule of contra proferentem, which states that ambiguous terms in a contract should be construed against the party who drafted the contract (the insurer in this case). The insurer's use of the word ""sudden"" to define ""Escape of Water"" damage is ambiguous, as it does not clearly encompass a slow leak. Ordinary speakers of English would understand ""sudden"" to mean occurring quickly or unexpectedly. Therefore, the court should interpret the term in a way that",-88.24091953,-65504,-65504,-65504,-65504

    - The phrase ""sudden/unforseen "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English as ""unexpected and unintentional."" - ""Damage"" is usually understood to be limited to the actual cost of repair of the damaged wall. - Since the burst pipe was an internal source, and there is ""Escape of Water"" coverage, the damage to Carol's wall is therefore covered.

Answer: A
Reasoning: This question requires the application of the common sense and ordinary meaning test.

        Ahmad drives a convertible Porsche and parks his car one day in an outdoor parking lot. While his car is parked in the lot, a baseball from a nearby little league game hits his car's front windshield. When he returns, he discovers a baseball near the car, and that the windshield appears chipped but otherwise functional and intact. Ahmad files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
    Considering just how the word ""broken glass"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Ahmad covered by the insurance? Options: A. Ahmad is not covered. B. Ahmad is covered.
