    I would say that no, he isn't covered. The insurance company probably means ""fire damage"" to mean something that was the result of a fire. ""Fire damage"" would be something burned, melted, or otherwise obviously damaged by fire. I think a smoldering cigarette would be considered ""smoke damage"" and wouldn't be covered.

Vehicle Fire III,agreement,"Ken's car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Fire,"" defined as ""loss or damage to the policy holder's car as a result of fire, lightning or explosion.""
    One day, Ken parks his car next to his home, and while he is out on a jog his neighbor's home catches fire. The fire spreads to Ken's car, which is subsequently destroyed in the blaze. Ken files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
    Considering just how the word ""fire damage"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Ken is covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes. I believe that Ken is covered because the definition of Vehicle Fire in his policy does not specify that the fire be accidental. In this case, the fire was started accidentally by the neighbor, but Ken's policy does not limit Vehicle Fire to accidental causes. However, there is a reason that insurance companies define their policies with very specific language: ""Fire Damage"" would most likely not have covered the damage to Ken's car in this case. Why? Because ""fire damage"" is generally understood to be damage caused by a fire that was started intentionally. In this case, the fire was started by accident, so",-163.55895541235805

    Hunter, who lives alone, goes on vacation and leaves his car in his home garage. However, surveillance footage captures a masked assailant breaking into his car and stealing Hunter's very high-end seat covers. Hunter files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
    Considering just how the word ""accessory"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Hunter is covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes. I believe Hunter is covered, because an accessory is a tool that assists or helps a person in performing a specific task. In this case, Hunter's car seat covers assisted the car by making it more comfortable for the driver and passengers. Hunter's seat covers fit the dictionary definition of an accessory, and therefore the insurance company should cover the loss.

    If you don't agree, you'll have to explain in detail your reasoning, but I think the answer is yes.

    If you agree, the law may have defined the word ""leaking"" in such a way that Madison is not covered.

    There is a reason that those who draft legislation do not rely on dictionaries. They have to define their terms for themselves, and they can do it in ways that have nothing to do with ordinary usage.

    And, of course, when the legislator defines ""leaking"" as ""leaking from a fixed oil-fired heating installation"" he has used a grammatical construction that ordinary speakers of English do not use.

    I disagree. I think ""leaking"" would be understood as a leak of liquid oil, and that's not what's happening here. It seems clear that ""leaking"" would not cover this, since that would make it too easy to cheat insurance companies.

    So, I think this is a ""good"" riddle, one that can teach us a bit about language and legal documents.

I believe Hunter is covered, because an accessory is a tool that assists or helps a person in committing a crime or some other wrongdoing.
