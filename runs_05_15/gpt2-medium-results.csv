    One evening, an earthquake erupts near Blake's house. The force of the earthquake causes Blake's house to shake, which damages the house's foundation. Blake files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
    Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Blake is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Blake,"
Blake's house is insured by the fire department and the city, and he hasn't received a complaint from either city department.

So when Blake's house doesn't claim any damages at all, then why did his insurance company tell him that it was the fault of the city of Oroville?
In short, all of the above is plausible, but not true.

 In December 1998, the Supreme Court ruled in Mather v. Mariam that oil spills are not civil tort. The court ruled that spills are classifiable as a civil right. The high court said there's no specific law preventing oil companies from intervening in spills. To them, oil spills are inevitable, but the court said a company can't shield itself from liability by refusing to clean up spills. The court ruled that because of the oil's chemical composition, oil spills are civil.

Blake's house is insured for $250,000. When he goes to work, his insurance covers the cost of all furniture, linens and utensils, plus some cleaning expenses. Blake's insurance company awards him $7,000 per month for his reasonable expenses. All of this costs $91,000. It's a lot of money, but it's less than the cost of the house.

So when Blake's house doesn't actually shake or tremble, then why does his insurance cover the damage? I doubt that the insurance company would be buying insurance on a $100,000 house and $10,000 demolition, for example.

An insurance policy is not a contract. A policy is merely an agreement between two parties. If one party has an argument that violates the terms of his policy, the other party's agreement will not be in jeopardy. A policy does not say that every action taken by a party will carry the same amount of legal consequences. Most policies are negotiated by two parties, such as spouses, partners, or employees.
