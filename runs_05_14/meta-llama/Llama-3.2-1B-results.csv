This is not to say that it would not be covered under his policy if he had purchased an add-on endorsement to cover damage to windows and skylights.

John takes generally good care of his car, but over the years he has noticed a gradual buildup of rust on his front left wheel. He brings the car to a mechanic to have the wheel replaced. John files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""wear and tear"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is John covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes!


Remember: The word ""wear and tear"" has a very specific meaning in a particular field of law: the law of motor vehicle insurance. It's a legal definition that's been around for almost a century, and it has been codified in statutes, case law, and insurance industry regulations. Most people don't know the law, but it's useful to know. 

Here's the definition of ""wear and tear"" used in an insurance policy that's been written for the motor vehicle insurance industry.

Remember: The word ""wear and tear"" has a very specific meaning in a particular field of law: the law of motor vehicle insurance.

For example, the word ""wear and tear"" is not a general legal definition because it doesn't have a clear and precise meaning.

Vehicle Damage II,yes_or_no,"John's car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Damage,"" which excludes ""loss or damage caused by wear and tear.""
John takes generally good care of his car, but one day he is involved in a minor accident which knocks his front left wheel out of alignment. He brings his car in to a mechanic to have the wheel re-aligned, but the mechanic tells John that his car will also need substantial repair work because the unaligned wheel has been scraping against the body of the car since the accident. John files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""wear and tear"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is John covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes!


Remember: The word ""wear and tear"" has two separate meanings and both have something to do with John's car. It may be that John's car has a worn-out front left wheel, but if the mechanic says that the front left wheel was damaged in the accident, then he is probably referring to the damage that the accident caused to the body of the car. In that case, John is not covered by his car insurance for that damage.

In other words, ""wear and tear"" is an extremely broad term,",

In fact, Peter is covered for thefts of his key in the case of a loss or damage to a goods carrying vehicle, including key replacement.
In this article, we will explain why Peter's insurance policy is valid in this case.
What is "" Key Theft ""?
In everyday use, the term "" Key theft "" is usually used to describe any theft of a key to a vehicle, especially if the vehicle is a car. However, in insurance, the term "" Key theft "" refers to a theft of a key to a vehicle used for transporting goods, for example, a van or a truck.

Considering just how the word ""key theft "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Peter covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes!

This is because the insurance company considers the ""key theft"" as a loss of a specific vehicle, and hence, as a loss of an insured vehicle.

One day, a hail storm hits Rick's house and causes damage to the plants on his balcony. Many plants lose leaves and some are completely covered in ice, causing them to die. Rick files a claim with his insurance company for the damage.

No. It means that the glass was broken. Thus, Rick's roof has been damaged from the hailstorm because ""it caused damage to hard surfaces."" Therefore, Rick is covered by his insurance policy.
So if a homeowner has a home insurance policy, he would be considered covered for damage from hail.

How many people are aware that ground heave means a situation where the soil beneath the building becomes unstable?

Before going to the legal interpretation part, I'd like to share a simple story about smoke damage. I work for a big insurance company. We have a policy in place which covers fire and smoke damage to the vehicles. Let's say you have a $10,000 car, and smoke damage to it damages it to $5,000. That will not be covered by your policy.

Considering just how the word ""fire damage"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Ken covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes! Ken is covered for vehicle fire damage. The reason is, in the event of a vehicle fire, the car is usually destroyed, and its owner (Ken) may have to replace it.

Now, consider a similar case. Let's assume that Ken doesn't own a car, but he is still living in the neighborhood. He comes home one night, and his house catches fire.
