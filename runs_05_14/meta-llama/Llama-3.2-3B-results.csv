In other words, the water damage is covered if it is a sudden/unforeseen flow of water.

    This is an obvious case of a gap between the terms of the policy and the plain language of the policy. Yes, there is an ambiguity about what a ""tracking device"" means.

    Because of the obvious ambiguity of the phrase ""tracking device,"" and because a tracking device is already explicitly mentioned in the policy, the courts hold that this language must be read as a condition rather than an exclusion.

Vehicle Theft VI,disagreement,"Cooper's car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Theft,"" which applies only if ""the policyholder's car contains a working GPS tracking device.""
    Cooper, who doesn't keep a GPS tracking device in his car, goes on vacation and leaves his car in his home garage. However, surveillance footage captures a masked assailant breaking into his car and driving away. Cooper files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
    Considering just how the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Cooper is covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,Yes," Yes! 
    Because of the obvious ambiguity of the phrase ""tracking device,"" and because a tracking device is the sort of thing that a person might reasonably expect to be covered by the policy, the court holds that the insurance company should cover Cooper's loss. 
    The court's decision is based on the principle of ""reasonable expectations,"" which means that the insurance company is required to fulfill the expectations of ordinary people. For example, if the insurance company says that a policy covers ""tracking device,"" then the insurance company should pay for a loss if the tracking device is used for legitimate purposes.

    Cooper, who keeps a GPS tracking device in his car, goes on vacation and leaves his car in his home garage. However, surveillance footage captures a masked assailant breaking into his car and driving away. Cooper files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
    Considering just how the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Cooper is covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,Yes," Yes! 
    Because of the obvious ambiguity of the phrase ""tracking device,"" and because a tracking device is the sort of thing that a person might want to protect, the inclusion of the word ""working"" is clearly redundant. 
    Moreover, the fact that Cooper's car has a tracking device is not something that we would reasonably expect an insurance company to know about, because the information is proprietary and would not be known by them.

Vehicle Theft VI,disagreement,"Cooper's car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Theft,"" which applies only if ""the policyholder's car contains a working GPS tracking device.""
    Cooper, who keeps a GPS-tracked smartphone in his car to play music and for navigation, goes on vacation and leaves his car in his home garage. However, surveillance footage captures a masked assailant breaking into his car and driving away. Cooper files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
    Considering just how the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Cooper is covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",controversial,Yes," Yes! 
    Because of the obvious ambiguity of the phrase ""tracking device,"" and because a tracking device is already explicitly mentioned in the policy, the courts have held that the inclusion of the word ""working"" is unnecessary. 
    If the tracking device were ""unworking,"" then Cooper would not be covered. 
    Thus, the phrase ""working GPS tracking device"" is redundant, and the word ""working"" is superfluous. 
    Therefore, the only reason that ""working GPS tracking device"" is not ambiguous would be if it were defined to mean a tracking device that is not working",
