Emergency Damages I,yes_or_no,"Joanne's home insurance covers ""Emergency Damages,"" defined as ""loss or damage to the contents of the policyholder's home caused when first responders force an entry into the policyholder's home because of an emergency or perceived emergency involving the policyholder.""
Late one night, Joanne hears loud crashing noises coming from another room in her home and knows it is just her two dogs playing together. From her bedroom, she frantically calls the police, who make a forced entry into her home to assess the situation. It turns out that the noises Joanne heard were indeed from her dogs; Joanne just wanted help subduing the dogs. Joanne files a claim with her insurance company for the damage caused by the forced entry.
Considering just how the word ""perceived emergency"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Joanne covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! In fact, Joanne's home insurance would cover such a claim under the policy's definition of ""Emergency Damages,"" and it is an example of the law of impossibles . Law of impossibles is a doctrine in contract law that states that when a party's contractual promise is impossible to perform, then the promisee cannot sue for breach of contract. The doctrine is based on the notion that if a party's performance is impossible, it is impossible for that party to breach the contract. In the case of Joanne's home insurance, it is impossible for her insurer to deny coverage for the damage caused by a forced entry into her home if the forced entry was made because of a perceived emergency. Joanne's insurer would therefore have no choice but to pay for the damage caused by the forced entry, regardless of whether the forced entry was indeed made because of an emergency or a perceived emergency. So, in this case, Joanne's insurer would be required to pay for the damage caused by the forced entry, and Joanne would not be able to sue for breach of contract.
Joanne's home insurance policy defines ""Emergency Damages"" as ""loss or damage to the contents of the policyholder's home caused when first responders force an entry into the policyholder's home because of an emergency or perceived emergency involving the policyholder."" According to this definition, Joanne's policy covers damage caused when first responders force an entry into her home because of a perceived emergency involving her.
The term ""perceived emergency"" is interpreted as a condition of the policy that the emergency is real or at least perceived as such. In other words, if Joanne's insurer can prove that there was no emergency or perceived emergency, the insurer would not be liable to pay the claim. However, if Joanne's insurer cannot prove this, then it would have to pay the claim, even if the emergency was a perceived one. This is because Joanne's insurer is contractually obligated to cover damage caused by a perceived emergency.
In summary, Joanne's home insurance covers ""Emergency Damages,"" defined as ""loss or damage to the contents of the policyholder's home caused when first responders force an entry into the policyholder's home because of an emergency or perceived emergency involving the policyholder."" In this case, the damage caused by the forced entry was caused by a perceived emergency, and the insurer would be required to pay for the damage.",-402.3266107422751
Emergency Damages I,yes_or_no,"Joanne's home insurance covers ""Emergency Damages,"" defined as ""loss or damage to the contents of the policyholder's home caused when first responders force an entry into the policyholder's home because of an emergency or perceived emergency involving the policyholder.""
Late one night, Joanne hears loud crashing noises coming from another room in her home and believes that a burglar has broken in. From her bedroom, she frantically calls the police, who make a forced entry into her home to assess the situation. It turns out that the noises Joanne heard were indeed from a burglar, whom the police promptly arrest. Joanne files a claim with her insurance company for the damage caused by the forced entry.
Considering just how the word ""perceived emergency"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Joanne covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! In fact, Joanne's home insurance would cover such a claim even if the burglar never actually broke into the house at all. The insurance company may deny Joanne's claim, but it would be for the reason that there was no ""emergency"" or ""perceived emergency"" at all. In the situation involving a perceived emergency, the ""emergency"" is the act of forcing a door open by a police officer in order to investigate an emergency or perceived emergency. The ""emergency"" or ""perceived emergency"" that triggers the insurance claim is the fact that the police officer is forced to do this in order to investigate an emergency or perceived emergency. The police officer's use of force is not the emergency or perceived emergency, but rather the circumstance in which the police officer must use force to investigate an emergency or perceived emergency. This is, after all, the very point of the police officer's presence in the first place: to investigate an emergency or perceived emergency. (In this regard, it is interesting to note that the language of ""emergency"" and ""perceived emergency"" are there for a purpose: to allow for the situation in which there is a perceived emergency but no actual emergency.)",-310.38821065658703
Emergency Damages I,yes_or_no,"Joanne's home insurance covers ""Emergency Damages,"" defined as ""loss or damage to the contents of the policyholder's home caused when first responders force an entry into the policyholder's home because of an emergency or perceived emergency involving the policyholder.""
Late one night, Joanne hears loud crashing noises coming from another room in her home and believes that a burglar has broken in. From her bedroom, she frantically calls the police, who make a forced entry into her home to assess the situation. It turns out that Joanne is experiencing mild paranoia after having recently watched a movie that involved a home burglary. Joanne files a claim with her insurance company for the damage caused by the forced entry.
Considering just how the word ""perceived emergency"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Joanne covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! In fact, Joanne's home insurance would cover such a claim under the policy's definition of ""Emergency Damages,"" and it is an example of the law of impossibles . Specifically, the policy is drafted such that the insurer would be unable to argue that there is no coverage because Joanne's belief was ""illusory,"" ""false,"" ""unreal,"" or ""wrong."" To be sure, such an argument could have been made under some other policy's definition of ""Emergency Damages"" (e.g., that of the policy's predecessor, which contained the following limitation: ""Loss or damage to the contents of the policyholder's home caused by the police or other law enforcement personnel acting in the course of their duties or otherwise responding to an emergency or perceived emergency involving the policyholder."") But the policy at issue here contains no such limitation.
The law of impossibles is not a common law doctrine but rather a rule of statutory interpretation (specifically, a rule of statutory construction). This is due to the fact that it is simply not possible for an insurance policy to contain a definition of ""Emergency Damages"" that is phrased such that a claim is not covered when, as here, the policyholder perceives an emergency even though there is no actual emergency. The reason for this is that, in the event of a claim, the insurer would have to disclaim coverage based on an argument that would lead to an absurd result. More specifically, if the insurer were to deny coverage based on Joanne's subjective experience of an emergency when, in fact, there was no emergency, then the insured would be left to bear the loss of the damage caused by the police. Conversely, if the insurer were to deny coverage because Joanne perceived an emergency when, in fact, there was no emergency, then the insurer would be responsible for any damage caused by the police, regardless of whether the insured perceived an emergency or not. Because of the possibility that Joanne could perceive an emergency even though there was no actual emergency, the definition of ""Emergency Damages"" cannot be phrased in a way that would allow the insurer to deny coverage based on Joanne's subjective experience of an emergency. Rather, the definition of ""Emergency Damages"" must be phrased such that there is coverage when Joanne perceives an emergency but no actual emergency. As a result, the insurer could only disclaim coverage based on an argument that would lead to a reasonable result: that the insurer would be able to deny coverage when the claimant perceived an emergency even though there was an actual emergency.
The law of impossibles is based on the principle that, when an insurer is faced with an argument that would lead to an absurd result, the insurer may not deny coverage based on that argument. As a result, the law of impossibles does not allow an insurer to deny coverage because the claimant's belief in an emergency was illusory, false, unreal, or wrong. Rather, the law of impossibles requires that the insurer deny coverage based on an argument that would lead to a reasonable result. For example, the insurer could deny coverage based on an argument that would lead to a reasonable result, such as the fact that Joanne's belief in an emergency was caused by the police's forced entry into her home.",-718.0807842798185

5 Tips for Hiring an Insurance Adjuster
While the official title of an insurance adjuster is an ""insurance claims adjuster,"" he or she is usually known by the term ""claims adjuster."" The word ""adjuster"" refers to the process of adjusting claims. An insurance adjuster's job is to adjust claims by determining the amount of damages and benefits due to the insured. Some claims are easier to adjust than others. The more complicated a claim, the more difficult it is to adjust.
1. Claims that are easy to adjust are those where a single event, such as a car accident, caused the damage. When an adjuster is dealing with a claim like this, he or she can simply look at the damages and decide how much the damages are worth. The adjuster can then determine the amount of benefits due to the insured and issue a check.
2. In claims that are more complicated to adjust, such as those where several events have occurred or where a single event has caused damage over several days, the adjuster must examine the damages in more detail. For example, if a home has been damaged by a flood, the adjuster must determine how much of the damage is due to the flood and how much is due to other causes. If it turns out that the flood is the main cause of the damage, the adjuster can simply decide how much of the damage is due to the flood and issue a check.
3. If the claim is complicated, the adjuster will need to consult with other experts, such as engineers, to determine the cause of the damage and the amount of benefits due to the insured. The adjuster will also need to consult with the insured to determine how much of the damage is due to the insured's negligence and how much is due to the insurer's negligence.
4. If the claim is complicated, the adjuster may need to consult with the insurer to determine how much of the damages are covered by the policy. For example, if the insurer has a policy that covers damage due to a flood, the adjuster may need to determine how much of the damage is due to the flood and how much is due to other causes.
5. If the claim is complicated, the adjuster may need to consult with the insured to determine how much of the damage is covered by the policy. For example, if the insured has a policy that covers damage due to a flood, the adjuster may need to determine how much of the damage is due to the flood and how much is due to other causes.
When you are hiring an insurance adjuster, it's important to know the type of claims that are easiest to adjust and the type of claims that are more complicated to adjust. The easier the claim is to adjust, the easier it will be for the adjuster to do his or her job. The more complicated the claim is, the more time and effort the adjuster will need to put into it.

What is the Purpose of a Mortgage Insurance Policy?
A mortgage insurance policy is a contract between a mortgage lender and a homeowner. The policy is designed to protect the lender in the event that the homeowner is unable to pay off the mortgage. The policy will pay off the mortgage in full if the homeowner dies, becomes permanently disabled, or is otherwise unable to pay off the mortgage.

Escape of Water I,yes_or_no,"Carol's home insurance policy includes coverage for ""Escape of Water"" damage, defined as ""damage to buildings and contents caused by a sudden, unforeseen flow of water from an internal source, such as a burst pipe or faulty appliance.""
Carol's bathroom wall has become severely damaged due to a pipe that slowly leaked over several days before Carol got around to calling a plumber who could fix the leak. Carol files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her wall.
Considering just how the word ""sudden/unforseen "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Carol covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! Carol is covered by her insurance policy. The leak was sudden and unforseen.
Here's what the policy says: ""If we determine that the escape of water was sudden and unforeseen, we will pay for any damage caused by the escape of water.""
When Carol's house insurance policy was written, the insurance company's agents had to have known that a burst pipe in a house was something that could and would happen. In other words, they knew that the burst pipe was a ""covered"" peril. The insurance company was betting that it would never have to pay out for such a loss. But it did, and now the insurance company will have to pay for the damage to the wall. That's the way insurance works. The insurance company is betting that it will never have to pay out, but then a claim comes in and the insurance company has to pay up.
When you think about it, it's not much different than what we do when we bet on a horse race. We're betting that our horse will win. The other bettors are betting on other horses. But if it's a major race, the bettors who bet on the winning horse have a good chance of winning their bets. The same is true with insurance. If you buy a home insurance policy, you are betting that you will never have a loss from a covered peril. The insurance company is betting that it won't have to pay out for covered losses. If you have a fire or a burst pipe or a tornado or a hurricane, the insurance company has to pay out. But the bettors are willing to take that chance because the premiums they pay are so low.
When Carol's pipe burst and water damaged her wall, she called her insurance company and filed a claim. The company paid her claim.
With a standard home insurance policy, the policyholder is covered for sudden and unforeseen escape of water from any source. The definition of sudden and unforeseen is that the water flow must be so fast that a person can't stop it and the damage can't be prevented. If the water flow is so slow that it can be controlled, the damage is not covered. If the water flow is slow enough that the person can stop it, the damage is covered. When the water flow is slow, it's called a ""leaky faucet"" and it's not covered.",-597.8333278507926

Carol's water damage would be covered under the policy if the pipe was caused by a defect in the pipe or if the pipe was damaged due to something outside the property. In other words, the water damage is covered if it is a sudden/unforeseen flow of water.
The common usage of ""sudden/unforeseen"" is understood as a sudden, unexpected flow of water from an internal source. In Carol's case, the water damage to her wall is covered under the insurance policy. It is a covered loss.",-193.1983693651855

Flood II,yes_or_no,"Rebecca has insurance that covers damage from ""Flooding"" to her home, defined as ""an invasion of the property by a large volume of water caused by a rapid build-up from outside the buildings.""
Rebecca lives in a house situated next to a small creek. The water level of the creek gradually rises over the course of several years, and one day Rebecca notices that water from the creek has begun to collect in her basement and cause significant damage. Rebecca files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""rapid build-up"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Rebecca covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! In fact, Rebecca is covered for damage from flooding even though her basement only got a few inches of water.
How did Rebecca get covered? Consider the clause, ""an invasion of the property by a large volume of water caused by a rapid build-up from outside the buildings."" Notice that the words ""rapid build-up"" are part of the description of flooding, but they are not part of the definition of flooding. Thus, the ""rapid build-up"" does not have to be caused by anything outside of the buildings for the flooding to be covered! Rebecca's insurance company only has to prove that water invaded her home and that the cause was a rapid build-up. Whether the rapid build-up was caused by a flood outside the building or something inside, it's covered.
In contrast, the clause ""an invasion of the property by a large volume of water from outside the buildings"" is not covered! In this case, the flooding would have to be caused by a flood outside the building, because the definition of flooding specifies that the flood must come from outside the building. In other words, there can't be a rapid build-up inside the building. So, in this case the cause of the flooding must be outside the building, otherwise it's not flooding.
Thus, in order to be covered, a rapid build-up from outside the buildings does not have to be caused by a flood outside the buildings! Rebecca is covered because the rapid build-up was caused by a flood outside the buildings.
It's important to understand that ""the cause"" of something in a description or definition is different from the ""cause of the cause"" of something. In this case, the cause of the flooding was a flood outside the building, but the rapid build-up was not the cause of the flood. The rapid build-up was a secondary cause, a cause of the cause.",-416.2203469707165

Notice that the words ""rapid build-up"" are part of the definition. How would the word ""rapid"" be understood by an ordinary speaker of English? ""Rapid"" means ""going fast."" ""Rapid build-up"" means ""an invasion of the property by a large volume of water that goes fast (from outside the buildings).""
What about the phrase ""an invasion of the property by a large volume of water""? This phrase would be understood by an ordinary speaker of English to mean ""an invasion of the property by a large volume of water."" So, even though Rebecca's house is not located in a flood zone, if water from outside the building invades the property and a large volume of water is the result, Rebecca is covered.",-186.9119458010682
Flood II,yes_or_no,"Rebecca has insurance that covers damage from ""Flooding"" to her home, defined as ""an invasion of the property by a large volume of water caused by a rapid build-up from outside the buildings.""
Rebecca lives in a house situated next to a small creek. The water level of the creek gradually rises over the course of about a week, and one day Rebecca notices that water from the creek has begun to collect in her basement and cause significant damage. Rebecca files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""rapid build-up"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Rebecca covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! In fact, Rebecca is covered for damage from flooding even though her basement only got a bit wet.
The term ""flood"" is a bit of a nebulous one in English, and it's important to understand how the term is used in insurance contracts, especially if you've ever filed an insurance claim. Most people use the term ""flood"" to mean an act of nature, and indeed, that's how it's used in some insurance contracts. But there is also a legal definition of flood that is used in contracts, and it's important for Rebecca to understand how the term is used in her contract before making her claim.
The legal definition of flood is a rapid build-up of water, which can be caused by a variety of factors. The flood can be caused by rain, melting snow, a dam breaking, or an uncontrolled flow of water through a sewer or storm drain system, for example. As long as the water build-up is rapid, an insurance contract will cover it, regardless of the cause. So if Rebecca's basement got wet from water that was rapidly flowing in from outside the building, her insurance will cover the damage.
In this case, the water build-up was caused by water from the creek slowly making its way into her basement. The water flowed in gradually, over the course of about a week, which is far too slow to be considered a rapid build-up. Because of this, Rebecca's insurance does not cover the damage caused by the water from the creek.
Rebecca's insurance contract does not cover damage from ""flooding"" to her home, defined as ""an invasion of the property by a large volume of water caused by a rapid build-up from outside the buildings."" Although Rebecca's basement got wet from the creek, the water did not build-up rapidly enough to be considered a flood.",-419.79060116461187

One day, while Margot is away from her home, her surveillance footage captures a neighbor's middle school-aged children trampling her plants. Margot files a claim with her insurance company for the loss.
Considering just how the word ""malicous people or vandals "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Margot covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! Margot is covered. The word ""malicous"" in the insurance policy means something like ""deliberately destructive"" or ""deliberately damaging."" It does not mean ""deliberately harmful"" or ""deliberately careless."" It does not mean ""deliberately malicious."" It doesn't mean ""deliberately evil."" It means ""deliberately destructive."" That's how it's understood by ordinary speakers of English. That's how it's understood by the judge. So, it's not that this is a bad way to define a term that would be understandable by ordinary speakers of English. It's not that this is an unprincipled way to define a term. It's that the term is defined in this way so that the insurance company gets the coverage it wants. (Because that's what insurance companies do.) That's not a bad thing. That's not a principled thing. It's what insurance companies do.
The other option was to say that the term ""malicious"" means something else, namely, ""deliberately harmful"" or ""deliberately careless."" And in the dictionary, there is a word ""malicious"" that means ""deliberately harmful"" or ""deliberately careless."" So, in the dictionary, ""malicious"" is defined in this way, too. But in the dictionary, that definition comes from the Latin word ""malus"" (meaning ""bad"") and the Latin word ""facio"" (meaning ""I do""). That is, in the dictionary, the Latin word ""malus"" (meaning ""bad"") is understood to mean ""deliberately harmful"" or ""deliberately careless."" So, the insurance company could have defined ""malicious"" the same way, but they chose not to. They chose a different definition. Not a better definition, but a different definition. And the judge ruled that the definition in the policy prevails.
And that's just another instance of the language game being played as it's supposed to be played. It's just an instance of the language game being played as it's supposed to be played.

Remember: The word ""produces"" means to make, create or cause to exist. 
When someone or something produces a given result, they are responsible for that result. 
For example, if you drive your car over a cliff, you are responsible for causing the car to fall over. 
If you hit a cat with your car, you are responsible for causing the cat to be run over. 
The same is true for hot work. If someone does hot work and causes an accident, that person is responsible for the resulting damages. 
The word ""requires"" is similar to ""produces."" It means to need or to make necessary. 
For example, if your body requires food, it means that your body needs food to exist. 
If you live in a cold climate, you may require a coat to survive. 
The same is true for hot work. If someone does hot work and it causes an accident, they are responsible for the resulting damages. 
The word ""uses"" is similar to ""produces"" and ""requires."" It means to make use of or to consume.

In this case, we can draw a clear distinction between the ""cause"" of the damage and the ""source"" of the heat that produced the damage. 
A source is something that produces or creates something else. 
A cause, on the other hand, is that which brings about an effect. 
In this case, it is the cause that produces the damage. The source of the heat that produced the damage, the tool, would be excluded from coverage.

Hot Work II,yes_or_no,"Martha has an insurance policy that covers accidental damage to her home and belongings from ""Hot Work,"" defined as ""any work that requires, uses or produces any sources of heat that could ignite flammable materials."" 
Martha is installing hardwood flooring in her living room. She uses a heat gun -- a device that emits very hot air -- to help dry the glue that attaches the floorboards. While arranging her floorboards, she sets her heat gun down on her expensive dining room table, which severely warps the table's surface. Martha files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""flammable or combustable materials"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Martha covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! I know it is a trick question. The correct answer is: Not only does Martha have coverage, she has a very good chance of collecting on her claim, and here's why.
First, let's take a look at some of the conditions that Martha's insurance policy would be required to provide. Most policies cover damage that is caused by the heat from a ""hot work"" operation. But how hot does the heat have to be? It need not be as hot as a blow torch or welding torch. The heat that is emitted from a heat gun is as hot as a blow torch, but it is a lot more controllable. Heat guns emit temperatures as high as 900 degrees Fahrenheit. That's pretty hot, but it isn't as hot as a blow torch or a welding torch. A blow torch can emit temperatures as high as 3300 degrees Fahrenheit. A welding torch emits temperatures as high as 4800 degrees Fahrenheit. Clearly, the heat that Martha's heat gun emits is much less severe than the heat that would be emitted from a welding torch. So it follows that Martha's heat gun would fall within the definition of a ""hot work"" device. Thus, she has coverage under her policy for the damage to the dining room table.
Martha's insurance policy would also provide coverage for the heat gun itself. Most policies cover the heat gun for damage that is caused by the heat from the device itself. That means that if Martha's heat gun burns out, she has coverage for the cost to replace it. It also means that if the heat gun starts a fire in her home, she has coverage for the resulting damage. Note, however, that if the heat gun burns out while she is installing hardwood flooring, she would not have coverage for the replacement cost of the heat gun. That is because a fire would have started, and she would be covered by the provisions of the hot work clause.
Martha would have coverage under her insurance policy for the damage that she caused to her dining room table, even though the table is not flammable or combustable. That's because the table was damaged by heat, not by fire. But if the heat gun accidentally caused the fire, she would not have coverage for the resulting damage. That's because damage that is caused by fire is not covered by the hot work clause. However, if the fire was caused by an electrical malfunction, she would be covered. That's because a malfunctioning electrical device is considered to be a ""hot work"" device, and the hot work clause would apply.",-608.705315225001

Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! I know it is a trick question. The correct answer is: Not only does Martha have coverage, she has a very good chance of collecting on her policy, and here's why.
First, let's define ""Hot Work."" The definition from the dictionary is ""work requiring heat or fire."" This doesn't mean the use of fire, just heat. The OED states that ""work requiring heat or fire"" means ""work involving a source of heat or fire, esp. work with an open flame that could ignite flammable materials."" The word ""flammable"" means something is ""easily ignited,"" and it is defined as ""flammable"" if it will burn when exposed to ""heat, flame, or spark."" The definition of ""flammable"" means ""easily ignited,"" and it is defined as ""flammable"" if it will burn when exposed to ""heat, flame, or spark."" (Emphasis added.) 
So, the word ""flammable"" is defined to include heat as well as fire. We can infer from the word ""flammable"" that there is no distinction between heat and fire in the dictionary's definition of the word. 
There is, however, another definition of the word ""flammable"" that is important to this case: ""able to be set on fire easily."" This is the definition that the courts tend to use when deciding whether someone is covered by their homeowner's insurance for damage caused by a fire. This definition of ""flammable"" means that a material is ""easily ignitable"" by fire, and it is defined as ""flammable"" if it will burn when exposed to fire, not just heat. (Emphasis added.) 
It's important to note that these two definitions are not the same. The dictionary's definition of ""flammable"" states that a material is ""easily ignitable"" by either heat or fire. The dictionary definition of ""flammable"" includes heat as well as fire, and it does not distinguish between the two. On the other hand, the courts' definition of ""flammable"" only includes fire. 
So, if someone sets fire to a table made of wood, which is a flammable material according to the dictionary definition of the word, and the damage to the table was caused by the fire, the courts would likely find that the person is covered by their homeowner's insurance because the dictionary definition of ""flammable"" includes heat as well as fire. 
However, if someone sets fire to a table made of wood, which is a flammable material according to the dictionary definition of the word, but the damage to the table was caused by heat, not fire, the courts would likely not find that the person is covered by their homeowner's insurance because the dictionary definition of ""flammable"" only includes fire. 
So, if someone sets fire to a table made of wood, which is a flammable material according to the dictionary definition of the word, and the damage to the table was caused by the fire, the courts would likely find that the person is covered by their homeowner's insurance because the dictionary definition of ""flammable"" includes heat as well as fire. 
But, what if the damage to the table was caused by heat, not fire? In that case, the courts would likely not find that the person is covered by their homeowner's insurance because the dictionary definition of ""flammable"" only includes fire. 
So, the question is, does Martha's policy cover her for damage caused by heat? The answer is yes, because the dictionary definition of ""flammable"" includes heat as well as fire. This means that if someone sets fire to a table made of wood, which is a flammable material according to the dictionary definition of the word, and the damage to the table was caused by the fire, the courts would likely find that the person is covered by their homeowner's insurance because the dictionary definition of ""flammable"" includes heat as well as fire.

Hot Work II,yes_or_no,"Martha has an insurance policy that covers accidental damage to her home and belongings from ""Hot Work,"" defined as ""any work that requires, uses or produces any sources of heat that could ignite flammable materials."" 
Martha is installing hardwood flooring in her living room. She uses a heat gun -- a device that emits very hot air -- to help dry the glue that attaches the floorboards. While arranging her floorboards, she sets her heat gun down on her expensive dining room table, which causes the surface of the table to burn but not catch fire. Martha files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.

Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! I know it doesn't seem right, but that's how the dictionary and the legal system uses the word.

Denise is moving to a new home on the other side of town. She pays a professional moving company to move her belongings out of her current home. During the move, the moving truck is involved in a minor accident that damages several pieces of her furniture and other belongings. Denise files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her belongings.  
Considering just how the word ""professional movers "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Denise covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes!  
Remember: The insurance policy is an agreement between the insurance company and the policyholder. The policy defines what is covered and what is not.  
In this case, the policy states that it will cover ""damage to belongings caused while being removed by professional removal contractors from the home."" The policy defines professional removal contractors as a moving company, such as U-Haul or Interstate Van Lines. But it does not cover damage to belongings if a homeowner does the moving herself. 
Consider the following questions: 
1. What would be the most likely way to determine if the moving company is a professional removal contractor? 
2. What does the policy mean by ""while being removed""? 
3. Which of the following would be examples of damage to belongings caused while being removed by a professional removal contractor? 
a. a vase breaks when the movers drop it from the truck. 
b. a couch is damaged when the movers move it into the truck. 
c. an expensive lamp is broken when the movers pack it in the truck. 
d. a water heater leaks while being moved out of the home.

House Removal I,yes_or_no,"Denise's insurance covers damage from ""House Removal,"" defined as ""damage to belongings caused while being removed by professional removal contractors from the home.""
Denise is moving to a new home on the other side of town. She asks her uncle, a retired professional mover, to help move her belongings out of her current home. During the move, her uncle's truck is involved in a minor accident that damages several pieces of her furniture and other belongings. Denise files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her belongings.
Considering just how the word ""professional movers"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Denise covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! I know some of you will object to this one, but in my opinion this is a clear-cut case of ""Damages to Property"" caused by a covered accident.
1. ""Professional Movers"" means ""people who do this kind of work for a living."" Thus, her uncle is a professional mover. There's no question about that.
2. ""Being removed from the Home"" means being removed by ""professional movers"". That's clearly established by the preceding sentence ""Damage to belongings caused while being removed by professional removal contractors from the home.""
The word ""home"" is a mass noun. It means ""the place where one lives, usually one's principal residence"", but in this case, it also means ""the place where something is stored"". One can ""store things in one's home"" (e.g. ""There's a place where I store my spare tires; I can't remember where that is."")
For my own purposes, I'm going to define ""being removed from the home"" as ""being removed from the place where one stores one's belongings."" That's the same as saying ""being removed from the home,"" but it makes more sense in this context, since the uncle is not moving Denise's house; he's moving her possessions from one place to another.
In my opinion, there's no doubt that this is a covered situation under the policy. That said, I'd like to point out that there are other ways of getting coverage for this situation:
1. If the uncle's insurance covers the cost of moving Denise's belongings, and the moving is covered by his insurance, then Denise's belongings would be covered by the moving insurance.
2. If the uncle's moving business is covered by his insurance, and the moving is covered by his insurance, then Denise's belongings would be covered by the moving insurance.
3. If the uncle's moving business is covered by his insurance, and the moving is covered by Denise's insurance, then Denise's belongings would be covered by the moving insurance.
4. If Denise's insurance covers the cost of moving her belongings, and the moving is covered by her insurance, then Denise's belongings would be covered by the moving insurance.
5. If Denise's insurance covers the cost of moving her belongings, and the moving is covered by Denise's insurance, then Denise's belongings would be covered by the moving insurance.
6. If Denise's insurance covers the cost of moving her belongings, and the moving is covered by Denise's insurance, then Denise's belongings would be covered by the moving insurance.
7. If Denise's insurance covers the cost of moving her belongings, and the moving is covered by Denise's insurance, then Denise's belongings would be covered by the moving insurance.
8. If Denise's insurance covers the cost of moving her belongings, and the moving is covered by Denise's insurance, then Denise's belongings would be covered by the moving insurance.
9. If Denise's insurance covers the cost of moving her belongings, and the moving is covered by Denise's insurance, then Denise's belongings would be covered by the moving insurance.
10. If Denise's insurance covers the cost of moving her belongings, and the moving is covered by Denise's insurance, then Denise's belongings would be covered by the moving insurance.
11. If Denise's insurance covers the cost of moving her belongings, and the moving is covered by Denise's insurance, then Denise's belongings would be covered by the moving insurance.

Harper is moving to a new home on the other side of town. Because her old home has already sold and her new home is not yet ready for her to move in, she checks into a hotel and asks her cousin Bill -- who owns a moving company -- to store some of her belongings in his personal office. A couple days before she is set to move in, Bill's office floods, which ruins the items that Bill was storing for Harper. Harper files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her belongings.
Considering just how the word ""professional movers"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Harper covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! I know some of you will object to this one, but in my view this is a clear application of the ""classical"" approach to insurance -- the one that sees the policy as a contract between two parties, in which one party agrees to pay a certain amount of money to another party, in exchange for the second party agreeing to take certain actions. The policy is simply a promise to pay for damages. It is not a promise to perform. It does not require that the insured party performs any particular action, or that any particular action is taken, for the insurer to pay the claim. The insured party is free to carry out any action, or take any action, or carry out no action, or take no action, for the insurer to pay the claim. So when the insured party makes a claim for a loss, the insurance company is free to ask the insured party to provide evidence that the insured party actually performed the action that the insurer is now supposed to pay for. If the insured party cannot provide that evidence, then the insurer is free to deny the claim. If, on the other hand, the insured party can provide the evidence, then the insurer is bound to pay the claim.
The insurance company's role in this scenario is not to determine whether the insured party's actions were actually performed, but to pay for the insured party's actions. The insurance company's role is not to determine whether the insured party's actions were actually performed, but to pay for the insured party's actions.
When we have insurance, the most important question is not whether the insured party performed the actions that the insurer is going to pay for, but whether the insured party's actions are going to be covered by the policy. The insured party's actions are not the same as the policy, but they are closely related.
In the case of Harper's insurance, the insurance company's role is not to determine whether Harper's actions were actually performed, but to pay for her actions. If Harper's actions are actually performed, the insurance company's role is not to determine whether the actions are covered by the policy, but to pay for the actions.

Considering just how the word ""temporarily removed"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Vivian covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
Remember: The word ""away"" can modify a noun in several ways. It can refer to the direction or away from a place. It can refer to a period of time or duration. It can refer to a thing or an object. It can also refer to a place or a location. Finally, it can refer to an event or an action. 
Here, the word ""away"" modifies ""home."" It means ""away from home."" In other words, ""away from home"" is an adverbial phrase. This phrase is a postmodifier of ""house,"" and it modifies the noun ""house"" in the phrase ""damage to house."" 
In this sentence, we can replace the adverbial phrase ""away from home"" with the word ""temporarily."" In doing so, we get the following sentence: 
""Vivian has home insurance for 'Loss and Accidental Damage,' which only applies if the damage occurs 'while temporarily away from home anywhere in the world.'""

The word ""away"" was initially used to mean ""hidden away,"" which came to mean ""removed to a separate place,"" which came to mean ""removed temporarily."" 
The word ""temporarily removed"" is known as ""idiosyncratic usage"" because it is ""non-standard"" or ""informal."" But this is not a bad thing. In fact, it is a good thing! Using non-standard or informal language is how new ideas get created and spread. 
The word ""temporarily removed"" is not a set phrase, it is not part of the dictionary, and it is not generally used in everyday conversations. This is because it is very new and it is still being used to refine or change its meaning.

As part of his bakery business, Peter owns a van which he uses to make local deliveries. One day, Peter lends the van to an absent-minded acquaintance, who returns the van but neglects to return the key and does not answer Peter's insistent calls. Replacing the key costs Peter hundreds of dollars. Peter files a claim with his insurance company for his losses.
Considering just how the word ""key theft "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Peter covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! In fact, Peter is covered for theft of his key, in addition to the lost value of the van.
How many times have we seen this? Peter, your business partner's van was stolen, and they want to pay you for it. They say they will replace the value of the van. But the keys are still missing. They say ""well, the van was stolen, and the keys were stolen, so we will pay for both. You will get your van back, with the keys, and our insurance will pay the cost of the van.""
Wrong! The keys are not considered part of the van, and they are not covered by the insurance. But the van is covered, and the insurer will pay for the value of the van. The insurer will not pay for the keys. (In Canada, the van is covered, and the keys are covered. In the United States, the van is covered, and the keys are not covered.)
The insurer only covers the van. The keys are covered by the homeowner's insurance, not the insurer.
The insurer must pay for the replacement value of the van, plus the deductible (if applicable). The deductible is the amount you have to pay before the insurance will cover the cost of the van.
The insurer will also pay for any towing and storage costs, plus the cost of the rental car.

Gwen is covered by her insurance policy. The phrase ""traveling in your car"" in the personal accident coverage of Gwen's insurance policy is an example of a place clause.
A place clause is a phrase that refers to a specific place or location. ""Traveling in your car"" is an example of a place clause. A place clause is essentially a clause that refers to a location and modifies a noun. For example, ""traveling in your car"" modifies the noun ""Gwen's car"" and refers to the location where Gwen was driving her car when she was injured.
In this context, it is clear that ""traveling in your car"" refers to the location where Gwen was driving her car at the time of the accident. This interpretation is reinforced by the fact that the phrase ""personal accident"" is used to describe the type of injury that Gwen suffered. In this case, ""personal accident"" refers to an injury that occurred while Gwen was traveling in her car.
Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the phrase ""traveling in your car"" in Gwen's insurance policy refers to the location where Gwen was driving her car at the time of the accident.

Ground Heave I,yes_or_no,"Blake has home insurance that covers ""Ground Heave"" damage, defined as ""loss or damage resulting from ground heave of the site on which the building stands, or landslip.""
One evening, several of Blake's friends crowd into his house for a dance party. The many rambunctious dancers cause Blake's house to shake, which damages the house's foundation. Blake files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Blake covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
Blake's insurance company, in its definition of ""ground heave"", does not specify that ground heave must be caused by a natural phenomenon (earthquake, tremor, etc.), but only by ""ground heave"". Ground heave can also be caused by mechanical vibrations, such as those caused by a party. 
Of course, this is a hypothetical case. Parties may cause ground heave, but only in some cases. It is not a guarantee. 
Consider the following questions: 
1. What would be the chances of causing ground heave by a party in a house? 
2. What would be the chances of causing ground heave by a party in a house that was built on a hillside, rather than a flat plain? 
3. What would be the chances of causing ground heave by a party in a house that was built on a hillside that was unstable and vulnerable to landslides?

6. What would be the chances of causing ground heave by a party in a house that was built on a hillside that was unstable and vulnerable to landslides, in the presence of a seismic fault, if a strong earthquake occurred and the ground heaved? 
7. What would be the chances of causing ground heave by a party in a house that was built on a hillside that was unstable and vulnerable to landslides, in the presence of a seismic fault, if a strong earthquake occurred, the ground heaved, and the house collapsed? 
8.

Remember: The insurance policy is an agreement between you and your insurance company. Your insurance company is the insurer, and you are the insured. 
In this case, the insurance policy provides coverage for damage resulting from ground heave. 
The insurance company's job is to make sure that the insured doesn't get an unfair windfall, and that the insurer is protected from an unfair loss. 
Clint's policy covers the loss, but the insurance company may require Clint to defend or settle the claim. 
The insurance company has a responsibility to ensure that the insurer doesn't get a loss greater than it reasonably could have expected. 
The insurer also has a responsibility to ensure that the insured doesn't get a windfall greater than it reasonably could have expected. 
Clint and the insurance company can negotiate the ultimate settlement of the loss, and the insurance company may consider an assignment of the insurance proceeds to Clint or his estate to obtain a better settlement. 
The insurance company is required to pay claims, but may require the insured to defend or settle the claim.

One day, Clint hears a loud crash in his house and finds that the ground beneath his house has shifted, causing his house's foundation to crack. Clint files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Clint covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! 
Remember: The insurance policy is an agreement between you and your insurance company. Your insurance company is the insurer, and you are the insured. 
In this case, the insurance policy provides coverage for damage resulting from ground heave. So, when the ground beneath Clint's house shifted and his house foundation cracked, the insurer agreed to pay for the damage. 
However, there may be some exclusions in the policy that would apply if the damage was not caused by ground heave. For example, if the damage was caused by a natural disaster, such as an earthquake or a flood, the insurer may not be obligated to cover the damage. It's important to read the policy carefully and understand the terms and conditions to know what is and what is not covered. 
In conclusion, if the damage was caused by ground heave, Clint would be covered by his insurance policy. However, if the damage was caused by a natural disaster, the insurer may not be obligated to cover the damage.",-155.96050677298626

One day, Clint hears a loud crash in his house and finds that a large tree has fallen on his roof, causing significant damage. Clint files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Clint covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! 
Remember: The insurance policy is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured, and the language used in the policy is a key factor in determining whether the insurer must pay the claim. 
The policy language is clear and specific: it explicitly states that ""Ground Heave"" is covered, and it applies to damage resulting from ""Ground Heave.""
Thus, even if the actual cause of the damage was something other than ""ground heave,"" such as a tornado, the policy still covers the damage caused by the tree falling on the roof. 
The fact that the policy explicitly covers ""Ground Heave"" and defines it as including damage from ""tornadoes"" or ""landslides,"" shows that the insurer intended to cover this type of damage regardless of the cause. 
If the insured had argued that the policy only covered damage caused by ground heave, the insurer might have had a different interpretation of the policy language and denied coverage. However, because the policy is clear and specific, the insured is entitled to coverage.",-240.67884574033087

Jett discovers that his house's water pressure is very low, and he calls an inspector to survey what may be the issue. Floorboards have to be removed to access the piping. It is then discovered that the issue is due to the fact that Jett did an extremely poor job installing the piping. Jett files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""accidental "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Jett covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! I think it is appropriate to understand the definition of ""accidental"" and ""necessary and reasonable"" in the context of the ""Trace and Access"" clause, and this is what this essay will address. 
The first thing that we should do when deciding if Jett has insurance coverage is to consider the legal definition of the word ""accidental."" Is Jett's act an ""accident""? An accident is defined as ""an unforeseen event or happening that is not intended or expected and that causes harm, damage, or loss."" Jett's act can be called an accident, because he did not intend to do anything, and he did not expect the damage to occur. Thus, it is an accident that Jett was responsible for, and it was an ""accident"" that he did not do a good job installing the piping. 
The next question is: Is Jett's act ""reasonable""? As in ""necessary and reasonable costs?"" According to an article in the New York Times, ""the term 'reasonable' in the policy means reasonable in the sense that it is not absurd, unreasonable, excessive, extreme, or oppressive."" Jett's act is reasonable because, although it was very poor, it was not absurd, unreasonable, excessive, extreme, or oppressive. In fact, Jett's act was a necessary act in order to determine what was wrong with his plumbing. 
Another question that we should ask is, ""What is covered by insurance?"" According to an article in the New York Times, ""insurance is a contract between the insurer and the insured. The insurer promises to pay the insured, while the insured promises to pay the insurer in the event of a loss or damage."" The insurance company promised to pay Jett the costs of fixing his plumbing, while Jett promised to pay the insurance company in the event that he lost money. 
What happens when a claim is made by the insured? What happens when a claim is denied? If a claim is denied, what are the consequences? What happens if a claim is denied? What are the consequences? These are all questions that we need to answer in order to understand if Jett has insurance coverage.

Vehicle Damage II,yes_or_no,"John's car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Damage,"" which excludes ""loss or damage caused by wear and tear.""
John takes generally good care of his car, but one day he is involved in a minor accident which damages his front left wheel. He brings the car to a mechanic to have the wheel replaced. John files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""wear and tear"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is John covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! 
Remember: The word ""wear and tear"" has a very specific meaning in legal contexts, and the meaning of the word ""wear and tear"" may differ from other contexts. 
John's policy is clearly designed to cover damage to his vehicle caused by accident or other event, but not by wear and tear. Thus, the exclusion ""loss or damage caused by wear and tear"" would apply to the damages in the case.
Wear and tear is a concept that is much more commonly understood in the context of ownership of real property (i.e., a house or apartment). There, the landlord or homeowner typically makes repairs to the house to make it last as long as possible. Thus, a landlord would likely refuse to pay for repairs caused by wear and tear, because the damages are due to the normal use of the house and were not caused by an accident or other incident. 
On the other hand, in the context of vehicle ownership, there is no expectation that a car will last forever, and thus there is no expectation that the cost of repairing damages caused by wear and tear will be paid by the owner of the vehicle. 
Thus, in the context of vehicle ownership, the phrase ""wear and tear"" does not refer to the normal use of the car, but rather to damage caused by the natural process of disintegration, which is gradual and progressive. 
John's insurance policy is designed to protect his car against damage caused by an accident or other event, but not by wear and tear. Thus, the damage to the wheel in the case would not be covered by the insurance.",-413.02512199879857
Vehicle Damage II,yes_or_no,"John's car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Damage,"" which excludes ""loss or damage caused by wear and tear.""
John takes generally good care of his car, but one day he is involved in a minor accident which knocks his front left wheel out of alignment. He brings his car in to a mechanic to have the wheel re-aligned, but the mechanic tells John that his car will also need substantial repair work because the unaligned wheel has been scraping against the body of the car since the accident. John files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""wear and tear"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is John covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! 
Remember: The word ""wear and tear"" has a very specific meaning in legal contexts, and the meaning of the word ""wear and tear"" in this context is the opposite of the meaning of the word ""wear and tear"" in ordinary usage. 
When the insurance company issued its policy, it was under an obligation to insure ""Vehicle Damage"" caused by any act of nature, and John's accident was clearly an act of nature. That is, it was not ""wear and tear"" 
The claim that the mechanic has made is that the front left wheel has been rubbing against the front left fender since the accident, and that the fender has thus been worn down and become brittle, making it more likely to break under stress. This is wear and tear. 
If you think about it, a wheel scraping against a fender is not an act of nature. It is caused by the driver (John in this case). 
Thus the mechanic is wrong in claiming that the damage is due to wear and tear. It is not. The word ""wear and tear"" in this context should be replaced by the word ""act of man."" 
The insurance company should pay for the damage to the car. 
The insurance company has a duty to indemnify John against any loss or damage caused by an act of nature. 
The insurance company has no duty to indemnify John against any loss or damage caused by an act of man. 
The insurance company has no duty to indemnify John against any loss or damage caused by wear and tear.

Vehicle Damage III,yes_or_no,"Steve's car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Damage,"" defined as ""loss or damage to the policy holder's 1) car; or 2) car accessories (while in or on the car).""  
One day, Steve is involved in a minor accident. His favorite guitar, which was in the car at the time, was damaged. Steve files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""accessory"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Steve covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
Remember: The word ""accessory"" means a ""thing that goes with a particular person or thing; or used in a particular way."" (In this case, the car.) 
Although the guitar was not attached to the car, it was ""used in a particular way"" while Steve's car was in use. Therefore, the guitar qualifies as a ""car accessory"" under the policy definition. 
So, as long as the guitar was not stolen or destroyed, Steve would receive coverage for the damage, since the guitar is a ""car accessory"" as defined in the policy. 
How did Steve's car insurance policy cover Steve's loss? 
Steve's car insurance policy included coverage for Vehicle Damage, which was defined as:

Vehicle Damage III,yes_or_no,"Steve's car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Damage,"" defined as ""loss or damage to the policy holder's 1) car; or 2) car accessories (while in or on the car).""  
One day, Steve is involved in a minor accident. His GPS navigation system, which was in the car at the time, was damaged. Steve files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""accessory"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Steve covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! 
Remember: The word ""accessory"" means a ""thing that goes with a particular person or thing; or used in a particular way; something used to decorate a place or thing."" 
The word ""car"" is a generic term that can refer to a car, truck, van, SUV, etc. Thus, the navigation system is an accessory to the car. 
Here's the definition of ""accessory"" from the Merriam-Webster Dictionary: ""an article of clothing, jewelry, or the like, worn with or to enhance a particular dress or outfit or for personal decoration,"" or ""something such as an article of clothing, jewelry, or personal ornamentation that goes with a particular person or thing or that is used in a particular way.""
Merriam-Webster has a definition that appears to be helpful for this question: 
""accessory: something that goes with or belongs with something else or with someone else: something that adds to or enhances something else or someone else
accessory [ak-suh-see-er] 
1 : one that goes with or belongs with something else or with someone else
2 : something that adds to or enhances something else or someone else 
The navigation system is an accessory to the car, and thus Steve's insurance company should pay for the damage. 
Just because the navigation system is a small, separate device doesn't mean it isn't an accessory to the car. 
Consider another case: Steve has an audio system in his car. It is considered an ""accessory"" to his car because the audio system is used to enhance the experience of driving. 
Similarly, the GPS navigation system enhances Steve's driving experience. The navigation system allows Steve to be more efficient while driving. 
The car without the navigation system would be less efficient. 
The car without the navigation system would be less safe. 
The car without the navigation system would be less fun. 
Thus, the navigation system is an accessory to the car. 
The navigation system is used in a particular way. 
The navigation system adds to or enhances the car. 
The navigation system belongs with the car. 
Thus, the navigation system is an ""accessory"" to the car. 
Steve is covered by his insurance policy because the navigation system is an ""accessory"" to the car.

One day, Steve is involved in a minor accident. His tablet computer, which he uses for navigation and which was in the car at the time, was damaged. Steve files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""accessory"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Steve covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! 
Remember: The word ""accessory"" means a ""thing that goes with a particular person or thing; or used in a particular way."" (In this case, the car.) 
Although the word ""accessory"" does not appear in the insurance policy, the insurance company has a responsibility to insure Steve under the policy because: ""Accessory"" means ""any part of a thing"" and ""any part of a thing"" includes a ""part that goes with a thing."" 
In this case, the tablet computer that Steve uses for navigation is a part of the car and is therefore considered an ""accessory."" Therefore, the insurance company must insure Steve. 
In addition, the tablet computer is a ""thing that goes with a particular person or thing"" because it was in the car when Steve was involved in the accident. 
The insurance company's duty to Steve does not end there, however. Steve can demand more coverage than what is specified in the insurance contract. 
Steve can demand that the insurance company expand the coverage of ""accessory"" so that it includes ""computers used for navigation."" The insurance company cannot refuse the expansion because Steve is requesting coverage for a ""part of a thing"" that is already described in the policy as being covered. 
The insurance company can, however, deny Steve's claim for the damage to his tablet computer because Steve's policy does not specifically include coverage for ""computers used for navigation."" 
The insurance company can only refuse Steve's claim if Steve refuses to expand the coverage to include ""computers used for navigation.""",-397.5340927655634

How did we get here? Consider the clause, ""audio equipment (while in the car)."" 
The phrase ""audio equipment"" clearly refers to a particular kind of equipment, and is not just a cover-all phrase for ""anything that is not a car."" 
The phrase ""while in the car"" clearly modifies the phrase ""audio equipment."" 
The phrase ""audio equipment (while in the car)"" thus refers to the particular kind of equipment that is normally in the car (whatever that means).

Considering just how the word ""audio equipment"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Chris covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes!

One day, Chris is involved in a minor accident. His portable Bluetooth speaker, which was in the car at the time, was damaged. Chris files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""audio equipment"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Chris covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! Chris is covered under his policy for damage to his Bluetooth speaker in his car because the audio equipment is in the car. 
If Chris had owned the speaker, and it was in his garage, then no, he would not be covered. 
The ""Audio Equipment"" language in Chris's policy is ambiguous. 
Assume the policy contains the following definitions: 
• ""Vehicle"" means a vehicle as defined by the Motor Vehicle Code. 
• ""Audio Equipment"" means ""portable or fixed audio devices, including but not limited to: CD, DVD, portable media players, and cellular phone accessories used to listen to music, including ear buds and ear phones."" 
In determining whether Chris is covered, the court will consider the plain meaning of the terms ""car"" and ""audio equipment"" and the definitions of ""vehicle"" and ""audio equipment"" provided in the policy. 
Consider whether Chris's speaker would be considered to be ""audio equipment"" under the definition in the policy. 
Answer: Yes, because the speaker is ""portable or fixed audio devices, including but not limited to: CD, DVD, portable media players, and cellular phone accessories used to listen to music, including ear buds and ear phones.""
The following is a sample answer to this question: 
""Chris's speaker would be considered to be ""audio equipment"" under the definition in the policy because it is ""portable or fixed audio devices, including but not limited to: CD, DVD, portable media players, and cellular phone accessories used to listen to music, including ear buds and ear phones."" 
The word ""portable"" indicates that the speaker could be moved from one place to another. The word ""fixed"" indicates that the speaker could be located in one place. 
The word ""audio"" indicates that the speaker is a device that produces sound. 
The words ""devices, including but not limited to"" indicate that the speaker is one of several possible types of audio devices. 
The words ""CD, DVD, portable media players, and cellular phone accessories"" indicate that the speaker is capable of playing music. 
The words ""used to listen to music"" indicate that the speaker is designed for this purpose. 
The words ""including ear buds and ear phones"" indicate that the speaker is designed to be worn in the ear. 
Thus, under the definition in the policy, Chris's speaker would be considered to be ""audio equipment"" because it is portable, fixed, an audio device, one of several possible types of audio devices, capable of playing music, designed for listening to music, and designed to be worn in the ear."" 
Thus, Chris is covered by his insurance policy for the damage to his Bluetooth speaker in his car because the speaker is considered to be ""audio equipment"" under the policy.""",-430.5819743824395
Vehicle Damage V,yes_or_no,"James' car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Damage,"" defined as  ""damage to the policy holder's 1) car; or 2) car accessories, including children's car seats (while in or on the car)."" 
James is about to head out for work when he realizes he needs to clean out his car since he'll be taking some colleagues to lunch. He removes his child's car seat and places it on the trunk of the car. He heads back into his house to grab something he forgot, and he returns to find that the car seat has been stolen. James files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
Considering just how the word ""damage"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is James covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
Remember: The word ""damage"" can be used to refer to two different kinds of losses: (1) Harm to a person or persons (In this case, the car seat was removed from the car while in the possession of the insured); and (2) Loss to property.

James is about to head out for work when he realizes he needs to clean out his car since he'll be taking some colleagues to lunch. He removes his child's car seat and places it on the trunk of the car. He heads back into his house to grab something he forgot, and he returns to find that another car has crashed into his parked car. The car seat is severely damaged in the crash.

Considering just how the word ""damage"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is James covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! 
Remember: The word ""damage"" can be used to refer to two different kinds of phenomena in the real world: 
1. A direct physical effect, like a scratch on a car's body, or a broken window. 
2. An indirect effect, like a loss of use of a car, or an injury to a driver's health. 
In this case, James was hit by another car, and as a result, his car was scratched and damaged, and the car seat was damaged. The insurance policy covers the direct physical damage to the car and car accessories. It does not cover the indirect effect of the car being damaged, i.e. the loss of James' time to clean out the car. 
The reason for this is that the insurance policy was issued based on the assumption that the insured would not expect to be paid for indirect effects. If it were assumed that the insured would expect to be paid for indirect effects, there would be no reason for the insurance company to pay for indirect effects, since it would simply be paying out more money than it had collected in premiums.",-281.4585114028305

Why? Because the word ""audio"" refers to all of sound and does not specify any one kind of sound. In this case, ""audio"" means sound and the speaker refers to any sound, including sound that is caused by a defect in the car's stereo. 
The use of ""audio equipment"" in the definition of ""Vehicle Fire"" would lead an ordinary speaker of English to understand that ""Vehicle Fire"" covers loss or damage to any sound producing device, including the speakers of the stereo. The word ""audio"" does not specify any kind of sound (it is a mass noun). Furthermore, it is not clear that the loss of the smartphone was a result of a defect. There is also some ambiguity about the definition of ""Vehicle Fire"" because it does not state whether it includes loss or damage that results from an unattended fire. Gene's car does not have a fire extinguisher and his home is not equipped with a sprinkler system. ",-311.17368859192356

In fact, Joanne's home insurance would cover such a claim under the policy's definition of ""Emergency Damages,"" and it is an example of the law of impossibles . Specifically, the policy is drafted such that the ""emergency"" that can cause ""emergency damages"" to the contents of the policyholder's home is any emergency ""perceived"" by the policyholder to be an emergency.
The policyholder's belief that the emergency was an emergency will be deemed sufficient for the policy to cover the damage, even if the emergency was not in fact an emergency. The law of impossibles is a very common and powerful exception to ordinary rules of contract interpretation.

As such, the issue is more a matter of statutory interpretation and how the word ""perceived"" should be understood in this context. The court reasoned that the plain meaning of the phrase ""perceived emergency"" means something that appears to be an emergency, and that, in this case, Joanne's response to the noise caused her to perceive it as a burglary. The court found that, because Joanne's claim of a burglary was reasonable, the language of the policy was satisfied.
The court's analysis of the plain meaning of the word ""perceived"" is problematic, however, because it is not clear that the word ""perceived"" means the same thing when used in this context as it does when used in a different context, such as when a person sees something without actually seeing it with their own eyes. It is a rare case in which a reasonable person would interpret a word or phrase in one context to mean the same thing as it does in another context, especially when the two contexts have very different meanings.",-446.79104229656514
Emergency Damages I,no_or_yes,"Joanne's home insurance covers ""Emergency Damages,"" defined as ""loss or damage to the contents of the policyholder's home caused when first responders force an entry into the policyholder's home because of an emergency or perceived emergency involving the policyholder.""
Late one night, Joanne hears loud crashing noises coming from another room in her home and believes that a burglar has broken in. From her bedroom, she frantically calls the police, who make a forced entry into her home to assess the situation. It turns out that Joanne is experiencing mild paranoia after having recently watched a movie that involved a home burglary. Joanne files a claim with her insurance company for the damage caused by the forced entry.
Considering just how the word ""perceived emergency"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Joanne covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! In fact, Joanne's home insurance would cover such a claim under the policy's definition of ""Emergency Damages,"" and it is this very definition of ""emergency damages"" that is at the heart of this recent decision in Lickerman v. American Family Mutual Insurance Co.
The issue is whether Lickerman's insurer, American Family, must pay for the forced entry to his house and resulting damages. Lickerman was charged with possession of heroin and related paraphernalia and with two counts of violating the federal drug laws. He was represented by a public defender who arranged for a defense expert to conduct a home inspection. As part of the inspection, the expert entered Lickerman's home and found evidence that Lickerman was manufacturing heroin. The expert reported this to the state police. Lickerman was arrested and eventually convicted. He and his wife then filed an insurance claim for damages caused by the forced entry and damage to their home.
In dismissing the case, the district court noted that the facts of the case were not in dispute and that the real question before it was one of law and policy. Specifically, the court ruled that American Family's insurance policy did not cover the damages caused by the forced entry. However, the court also ruled that the policy's definition of ""Emergency Damages"" was sufficiently broad to encompass the conduct of the police officer that forced the entry.
American Family appealed the decision, arguing that the district court's reading of the policy was incorrect and that the damages caused by the police officer's conduct were not covered under the policy. On appeal, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling. According to the Court, the policy's definition of ""Emergency Damages"" is ""sufficiently broad to cover damages caused by the police officer's forced entry."" Thus, according to the Court, the policy's definition of ""Emergency Damages"" provides the ""governing interpretation"" of the term ""Emergency Damages"" and its plain language supports the ruling that the damages caused by the police officer's conduct are covered. The Court further held that the district court did not err in dismissing the case because the policy's definition of ""Emergency Damages"" is sufficiently broad to cover the damages caused by the police officer's conduct.",-556.2485231956307

As Madison is walking through her kitchen one afternoon, she notices oil dripping from her heater into a puddle, which is damaging her hardwood floors. Madison files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""leaking "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Madison covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! In fact, Madison is covered for damage from ""Escape of Oil"", and this is true because the definition of ""escape"" in this context is ""leakage.""
A key word in the policy is ""leakage,"" which means that oil ""leaking"" from the heater is covered. Most people would likely use the word ""leaking"" to describe oil dripping from a heater, but it is important to understand that ""leakage"" does not require that the oil drip for any particular amount of time.
The policy does not define ""oil"" for us, but we can assume that it means ""liquid oil."" It is not important that the oil be ""liquid oil."" It is enough that it be ""oil"" and that it ""leak.""
It is true that the heater has stopped dripping, but oil continues to drip and leak from the heater. All that is important is that oil is dripping and leaking from the heater.
To be sure, this is a crazy definition, but it is consistent with the way ""leakage"" is used in English. For example, if a faucet in your kitchen leaks, your insurance company is likely to cover the damage, even if the leak stops momentarily before you make a claim. If you do not like this definition, you can go out and buy insurance that only covers leaks that last a long time.
This case shows that we should be wary of accepting definitions of terms, even in insurance policies, without questioning their reasonableness.

In other words, ""leakage"" is being used here to mean ""leakage, a leakage"" -- that is, a constant, steady, continuous flow of liquid from a container.
I've seen the same thing happen in other contexts. For instance, if you have a broken sprinkler head and your home insurance covers ""sprinkler damage,"" you're covered even if it hasn't rained in a year and the sprinkler just dripped a few times.
In both cases, ""sprinkler"" and ""leak"" are being used as synonyms for ""water"" in a more general sense.",-718.8218815697619
Escape of Oil I,no_or_yes,"Madison has insurance that covers home damage from ""Escape of Oil,"" defined as ""oil leaking from a fixed oil-fired heating installation.""
As Madison's friend attempts to fix the heater in Madison's kitchen one afternoon, her friend makes a mistake which causes oil to rush out of the heater, damaging her hardwood floors. Madison files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""leaking "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Madison covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! In fact, Madison is covered for damage from all kinds of ""Escape of Oil"" (including fire). Here's why.
If you were asked to define ""leak,"" would you say it's something that doesn't occur in an oil-fired heating system? After all, oil doesn't ""leak"" from an oil heater. Rather, it runs out, right? So, a word that means ""leak"" cannot apply to an oil heater.
The reason is that the definition of ""leak"" is that of something that doesn't normally happen. You can't get a leak from an oil heater, since oil isn't supposed to come out of the heater. And since oil isn't supposed to come out, the definition of ""leak"" can't apply to oil heaters. Hence, oil heaters can't ""escape."" They're not supposed to. And if oil comes out, that is an escape, not a leak. So the word ""leak"" doesn't apply, and insurance companies are not responsible for ""leaks"" from oil heaters.
The same problem plagues other words. For example, the definition of ""leak"" is ""to escape through a small hole or crack."" So if you don't have a small hole in a heater, there can't be a leak. Similarly, ""leak"" is defined as ""a small amount of liquid or gas that escapes from a container, pipe, or other opening."" So if there is no container, pipe, or opening, then there can't be a leak. Hence, oil heaters can't leak.
The next time someone tells you that an oil heater ""leaked,"" you can tell him that oil heaters don't leak. In fact, they can't leak. You can also explain that if he would use the word ""escape"" instead, then he would be correct, since oil can escape from oil heaters. But if he would use the word ""leak,"" then he would be wrong, since oil can't leak from oil heaters.
So the next time someone asks you if you have insurance for ""leaks,"" or if you have insurance for ""escape of oil,"" you can explain that you have insurance for ""escape of oil,"" but you don't have insurance for ""leaks,"" since oil heaters can't leak. And you can explain that the same is true of ""fire,"" which is defined as ""a rapid outbreak and combustion of fuel."" So if you have an oil-fired heater, you can be assured that if you have an ""escape of oil"" fire, then your insurance company will pay for it.",-644.1891719131963

Escape of Water I,no_or_yes,"Carol's home insurance policy includes coverage for ""Escape of Water"" damage, defined as ""damage to buildings and contents caused by a sudden, unforeseen flow of water from an internal source, such as a burst pipe or faulty appliance.""
Carol's bathroom wall has become severely damaged due to a pipe that slowly leaked over several days before Carol got around to calling a plumber who could fix the leak. Carol files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her wall.

Here's what the policy says: ""If we determine that the escape of water was sudden and unforeseen, we will pay for any damage caused by it to buildings, contents or other property.""
The issue is not just the timing but the source of the leak. Is it the case that a leak from a water pipe in the wall is not ""sudden and unforeseen?"" Shouldn't the leak of the water have been unexpected? Shouldn't it have been surprising?
Consider that you're having a party. You tell your guests that your house is going to get power washed and they see a truck pull up in the driveway. They're expecting something else to happen. They're not expecting the power washing, they are expecting that you're going to clean the house inside and out. So, your guests are surprised by the power washing.
What if you said you were going to be in the shower and then you suddenly came out and said you were going to wash your car? Would that be considered ""sudden and unforeseen"" in the sense of power washing?
The issue is not just the timing but the source of the leak. Is it the case that a leak from a water pipe in the wall is not ""sudden and unforeseen?"" Shouldn't the leak of the water have been unexpected? Shouldn't it have been surprising?
For some reason, when I read that, I thought of some bizarre kind of leaky water pipe in a wall that was only leaking 1/10th of a gallon per hour. If that was the source of the leak, I'm not sure I would call that a ""sudden and unforeseen"" leak.
I'm not sure how the language would work out, but I would think that any water damage would be covered by the policy as long as it was unforeseen. What if the leak were due to a break in the wall? Would that be a covered loss? How about if the leak was the result of the water pressure being too high and it burst the pipe? Could the policy cover that?
As far as the source of the leak, I think that would have to be unforeseen. If the water pipe were installed improperly, then the leak would be covered. However, if the leak is the result of the pipe being too old and rusting out, then the leak would not be covered. So, if the leak was the result of some unusual condition in the pipe, then it would be covered. On the other hand, if the leak was the result of a normal condition, then it would not be covered.

How can I be sure that I am getting the best coverage and the best insurance company?
To ensure that you are getting the best coverage and the best insurance company, you should do your research and compare different insurance companies and policies. Look for coverage that meets your needs and budget, and consider factors such as customer service, claims process, and financial stability.
What do I need to do to make a claim with my insurance company?
To make a claim with your insurance company, you will need to contact your insurance company and provide them with the necessary information and documentation. This may include a detailed description of the damage, photos or videos of the damage, and any relevant documentation, such as receipts or repair estimates.
Do I need to pay any deductible or out-of-pocket costs before my insurance company covers the damage?
Yes, you will likely need to pay a deductible or out-of-pocket costs before your insurance company covers the damage. A deductible is the amount you are required to pay out of pocket before your insurance company starts covering the cost of repairs or replacement.
How long does it take for my insurance company to process my claim?
The processing time for your insurance company's claim may vary depending on several factors, such as the severity of the damage, the availability of documentation and repair estimates, and the complexity of the claim. It is important to be patient and communicate with your insurance company throughout the process.

Escape of Water II,no_or_yes,"Miranda's home insurance policy includes coverage for ""Escape of Water"" damage, defined as ""damage to buildings and contents caused by a sudden, unforeseen flow of water from an internal source, such as a burst pipe or faulty appliance.""
Miranda lives in a two-story house, and she has a large plastic water cooler on the upper floor. One day, the cooler begins to leak unexpectedly, causing water to seep through her floor and damage her walls. Miranda files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""flow of water "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Miranda covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes!

Belinda lives in a two-story house with a bathtub on the second floor. One day, Belinda fills the tub with tomato juice to give her dog a bath after being sprayed by a skunk, but the tub suddenly cracks and begins to leak, causing the tomato juice to seep through her floor and damage her walls. Belinda files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""internal source "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Belinda covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! In fact, no insurance company would deny her claim because of that definition and this is the reason that the term ""internal source "" is very vague.
In this article, we would like to discuss the definition of ""Internal Source "" in more details, which means that we would discuss the issue of ""Burden of Proof"" in relation to the ""Internal Source"" definition. In addition, we would discuss how the term ""Internal Source"" was defined in a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co. v. Lewis, 173 A.D.3d 1039, 1039 N.Y.S.3d 537 (2nd Department 2020).
I. Definition of ""Internal Source"" 
The term ""Internal Source"" is an important issue and it is very common in the insurance industry that clients are wondering what it means to have an ""internal source"" of water in their home. This is due to the fact that it is very hard to define this term in simple English, yet it is very important to understand what is an ""internal source"" in order to have a good understanding of the insurance coverage you are purchasing.
The term ""Internal Source"" means that a source of water, such as a burst pipe or a leaking roof, is within the walls of a building. This is important because if there is a burst pipe or a leaking roof, the insurance company will not cover the damages caused by the water.
In the case of Belinda, the insurance company will not cover the damages caused by the tomato juice because the source of the water, the tub, is an external source and not an internal source.
In other words, the tomato juice did not come from a burst pipe or a leaking roof, so the insurance company will not cover the damages caused by the tomato juice.
II. Burden of Proof 
When it comes to insurance claims, there is a concept called ""burden of proof,"" which means that the person making the claim has the responsibility of proving that the claim is valid. In other words, the person making the claim must provide evidence that supports their claim. 
In the case of Belinda, she had the burden of proof to show that the tomato juice was an internal source of water and not an external source. This means that she had to provide evidence that the source of the water was within the walls of her house, such as a burst pipe or a leaking roof. If she could not provide this evidence, then the insurance company would not cover the damages caused by the tomato juice.
In the case of Belinda, the insurance company will not cover the damages caused by the tomato juice because the source of the water, the tub, is an external source and not an internal source.
In other words, the tomato juice did not come from a burst pipe or a leaking roof, so the insurance company will not cover the damages caused by the tomato juice.
III. St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co. v. Lewis 
In the case of St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co. v. Lewis, the court had to decide whether the term ""internal source"" was defined in a way that would exclude the claim of the plaintiff, Mr. Lewis.
In this case, Mr. Lewis filed a claim with his insurance company after he suffered damages to his property due to a leaky roof. However, the insurance company denied his claim, stating that the leaky roof was an external source of water and was not covered by the policy.
Mr. Lewis argued that the term ""internal source"" should be interpreted in a way that would include the leaky roof, because it was within the walls of his house. He provided evidence to support his argument, including photographs of the leaky roof and an expert report from a roofing contractor.
The court considered the arguments of both sides and ultimately decided in favor of Mr. Lewis. The court interpreted the term ""internal source"" in a way that would include the leaky roof, stating that the policy was meant to cover damage caused by water that came from within the walls of the house. The court also noted that the insurance company had failed to provide any evidence that the leaky",-687.6602697909948

Fatema keeps a gas-powered grill next to her garage. One day, she uses the grill and leaves it briefly unattended. While she's away, burning embers from a nearby quick-moving brush fire make contact with the grill and cause its propane tank to explode, which in turn causes her garage to go up in flames.

In fact, she is covered for damage caused by a ""naturally occurring fire"" but not for the damage caused by the ""naturally occurring fire"" which accidentally started the fire that caused the garage to go up in flames.
You should be able to see why this is so by considering the following. Fire insurance policies are designed to cover the policyholder against the risk of loss caused by the fire. There is no coverage under such a policy for accidental or unintended damage caused by the fire. For example, if the insured property is damaged by fire, but the fire was accidentally started by the insured, there is no coverage under the policy. This is because the coverage under such a policy is for fire, and accidental fire is not fire.",-210.3451007627882

Flood II,no_or_yes,"Rebecca has insurance that covers damage from ""Flooding"" to her home, defined as ""an invasion of the property by a large volume of water caused by a rapid build-up from outside the buildings.""
Rebecca lives in a house situated next to a small creek. The water level of the creek gradually rises over the course of several years, and one day Rebecca notices that water from the creek has begun to collect in her basement and cause significant damage. Rebecca files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""rapid build-up"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Rebecca covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! In fact, Rebecca is covered for damage from flooding even though her basement only got a bit wet.
The term ""flood"" is a bit of a nebulous one in English, and it's important to understand how the term is used in insurance contracts. There is a reason Rebecca's insurance policy doesn't cover damage from ""Wet Basement"" or ""Moist Basement"" or ""Some water in basement."" Such damage would generally be covered by a home insurance policy, but would not be covered by an insurance policy that specifically covers damage from ""flood.""
In English, the term ""flood"" typically refers to an event that causes water to get into a house or other building that is located in a low-lying area, and this is typically caused by a rapid build-up of water from outside the buildings that causes the water to get into the basement or elsewhere. In some cases, this rapid build-up of water might be due to an opening of a dam, or a sudden burst of a river, or a sudden release of water from a water tower. In other cases, the water might slowly creep in over the course of several days or weeks, or it might rain, or the ground might become saturated, and water might slowly creep in over the course of months. But, in either case, there is typically a rapid build-up of water from outside the buildings that causes the water to get into the basement or elsewhere.
The way Rebecca's home insurance is written, it covers ""damage from flooding"" to her home, but only when the flooding is caused by ""a rapid build-up of water from outside the buildings."" In this case, the water in her basement may have crept in over the course of several weeks or even months, but the rapid build-up of water from outside the buildings caused the water to get into the basement. Rebecca is covered by her insurance policy for the damage to her home, even though the water in her basement may have been there for several weeks.
This article is part of a series on how to read insurance contracts, and the first two articles can be found here and here .
In this article, we consider the situation of Rebecca. We have a situation of damage to Rebecca's home. Rebecca's home is in a low-lying area, and the damage to Rebecca's home was caused by a rapid build-up of water from outside the buildings that caused the water to get into the basement or elsewhere.
We have a situation of damage to Rebecca's home, but we don't know whether Rebecca's insurance policy covers the damage. We need to look at the policy, and see how the term ""flood"" is defined in the policy.
Let's assume that Rebecca's insurance policy is the same as the standard homeowner's policy that most people have. Let's look at the policy to see what coverage it provides for ""flood.""
The standard homeowner's policy typically provides coverage for damage from flooding to the home, but only when the flooding is caused by a rapid build-up of water from outside the buildings that causes the water to get into the basement or elsewhere. In some cases, this rapid build-up of water might be due to an opening of a dam, or a sudden burst of a river, or a sudden release of water from a water tower. In other cases, the water might slowly creep in over the course of several days or weeks, or it might rain, or the ground might become saturated, and water might slowly creep in over the course of months. But, in either case, there is typically a rapid build-up of water from outside the buildings that causes the water to get into the basement or elsewhere.
So, in this case, Rebecca's insurance policy does cover the damage to her home, even though the water in her basement may have been there for several weeks. The rapid build-up of water from outside the buildings caused the water to get into the basement, and Rebecca is covered by her insurance policy for the damage to her home.

Flood II,no_or_yes,"Rebecca has insurance that covers damage from ""Flooding"" to her home, defined as ""an invasion of the property by a large volume of water caused by a rapid build-up from outside the buildings.""
Rebecca lives in a house situated next to a small creek. The water level of the creek quickly rises over the course of a few hours during a storm, and Rebecca notices that water from the creek has begun to collect in her basement and cause significant damage. Rebecca files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""rapid build-up"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Rebecca covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! In fact, Rebecca is covered for damage from flooding even though her house is not located in a flood zone.
How did Rebecca get covered? Consider the clause, ""an invasion of the property by a large volume of water caused by a rapid build-up from outside the buildings."" Notice that the words ""rapid build-up"" are part of the definition of flooding, but they are not part of the definition of ""outside the buildings."" ""Rapid build-up"" modifies ""water,"" and ""water"" modifies ""invasion of the property."" The word ""rapid"" modifies ""build-up,"" and ""build-up"" modifies ""large volume of water."" It is as if the definition reads: ""an invasion of the property by a large volume of water caused by a rapid build-up from outside the buildings."" The clause ""rapid build-up from outside the buildings"" is unnecessary. It is adjectival, and it can be omitted without changing the meaning of the definition. (In this case, it is not even necessary, since it is part of the definition!) Once the clause is omitted, the definition reads: ""an invasion of the property by a large volume of water caused by a rapid build-up."" And this definition does not refer to the distance of the water from the buildings. But, by virtue of the clause ""an invasion of the property by a large volume of water caused by a rapid build-up,"" Rebecca's property was flooded, and she is covered.
This case is a nice example of an adjectival clause that can be eliminated from a definition, without changing its meaning.
Most adjectival clauses can be eliminated from definitions, but some can not. Consider, for example, the clause ""who are in the habit of doing evil."" This clause is part of the definition of a ""wolf,"" and it cannot be eliminated, because it refers to the meaning of the definition itself.

Tompkins County, NY, Sentences Woman to Serve One Year in Jail and Pay $500 Fine for Being a Citizen of the United States
From Tompkins County, NY, District Attorney, Michele Garrigues, to my friend, Diane Dimond, an investigative journalist:
""I'm trying to get to the bottom of how the Tompkins County DA Michele Garrigues got a woman who was a citizen of the United States sentenced to one year in jail and pay a $500 fine for exercising her rights as a citizen of the United States by having a Bible in her car, and I'd like your help.""
It was a good call, Ms. Dimond, and I am very happy to try to help Ms. Garrigues with her investigation.
As I will explain, a couple of things make this case very fishy.
First, the Bible was not the only religious item in the car. Ms. Garrigues has not explained how it is that the woman was charged with ""having a Bible in her car,"" but not with the other religious items she had.
Second, if this case is not being framed in a way to make the woman's religious beliefs appear to be a criminal offense, then it is being framed in a way that Ms. Garrigues is just being a bad, vindictive prosecutor.
Third, the evidence of the woman's guilt is weak and does not match the penalty of a year in jail and a $500 fine.
I have a strong suspicion that Ms. Garrigues is engaged in a vindictive prosecution of Ms. Burdick, in order to advance the career of Ms. Garrigues, who is not only a Democrat, but a former chief deputy district attorney who served as the chief prosecutor in the case of Clinton County, NY, in which a man was convicted of murdering his ex-wife and her lover in 1992. Ms. Garrigues's husband, a former Clinton County judge, was convicted of child porn possession in 2010. Her husband was pardoned by New York State Governor David Paterson, a Democrat.
Ms. Garrigues is a Democrat, and the fact that a woman in a prominent position in the Democrat party has been convicted of child porn possession has led to accusations by some Democrats that Governor Paterson acted to protect his wife's career, and not to punish her husband, who did not appear to have done the same thing that he is accused of having done.
It is probably not a coincidence that the woman in this case is a Republican, and that she is being prosecuted by a Democrat, and that the Democrat, in addition, has a spouse who was convicted of child porn possession. I think this is a case of a Democrat prosecutor engaging in a politically motivated prosecution, in order to advance her career, even if it involves framing someone's religious beliefs as a criminal offense.

Garden Plants II,no_or_yes,"Margot has home insurance that covers ""Garden Plants"" damage, defined as ""damage to plants, bushes, shrubs and trees within the boundaries of the land belonging to the home caused by malicious people or vandals.""
One day, while Margot is away from her home, her surveillance footage captures a neighbor's middle school-aged children trampling her plants. Margot files a claim with her insurance company for the loss.
Considering just how the word ""malicous people or vandals "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Margot covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! Margot is covered. The word ""malicous"" in the insurance policy means something like ""deliberately destructive"" or ""deliberately damaging."" It doesn't mean ""deliberately hateful"" or ""deliberately insultive."" ""Vandals"" means ""people who destroy or vandalize property"" -- including ""deliberately damaging property."" The word ""property"" includes not only ""stuff"" but also ""plants."" Thus, when your insurance policy says ""malicious people or vandals,"" the word ""vandals"" refers to people who deliberately damage property, including plants. ""Vandalism"" includes deliberate damage to plants.
In other words, vandalism doesn't have to be done with an intent to offend or insult, it just has to be done deliberately. (Because that's what insurance policies are about: compensating people for losses that resulted from deliberate actions by other people.) And that's why Margot is covered by her insurance policy.
There's some further nuance here. Insurance companies often say that their policies cover ""malicious damage"" or ""deliberate damage."" The word ""malicious"" in those policies doesn't have the meaning it has in the previous policy. In the previous policy, ""malicious"" means ""deliberately destructive."" But in these policies, ""malicious"" means ""deliberately damaging,"" which is a narrower meaning than ""deliberately destructive."" Thus, if Margot had a policy that said ""malicious damage"" or ""deliberate damage,"" she'd have a narrower coverage than she does with the policy that says ""malicious people or vandals."" Her plants would still be covered, but people who deliberately vandalize would not be covered.",-420.65134360034426

Professional movers are a vital part of the American economy. Every year, professional movers make about 26 million trips to move 40 million people and their belongings. They move more than 45 million households and carry out about 18 million moves annually. There are more than 27,000 moving companies in the United States and Canada. An average American moves 11.7 times in his or her lifetime, according to the American Moving and Storage Association.
The majority of people who move choose a moving company over doing the work themselves. In fact, it is estimated that three out of four people hire a professional mover to move their belongings. A 2001 study showed that moving companies make up about half of the $10 billion spent annually on moving services in the United States. Moving services are the second largest retail service industry in the country, next only to automotive repair and maintenance. It is estimated that 70% of the population will move at least once in their lifetime.
There are different types of movers and each has its own set of requirements. Some movers are long-distance companies that move goods between states and countries. These movers must have certain requirements to be licensed by the federal government. In order to get a license, movers must go through a process of testing and training. These movers must follow certain guidelines that are set forth by the government in order to keep their license. The guidelines include things like how they handle the goods they are moving, how they notify the customer of any problems that may arise during the move, and how they file any claims for damages to the goods that may occur during the move.
In addition to long-distance movers, there are also local movers. Local movers are not required to get a license from the federal government, but they still must follow the same rules as long-distance movers. This includes the same guidelines as to how they handle the goods they are moving, how they notify the customer of any problems that may arise during the move, and how they file any claims for damages to the goods that may occur during the move.
One of the most important things to consider when looking at movers is their reliability. You want to make sure that the mover is going to be there when you need them and that they are going to do a good job. This can be difficult to determine, but there are some things you can look for to help you make an informed decision. One thing to look at is the length of time the mover has been in business. The longer they have been in business, the more likely they are to be reliable. Another thing to look at is the mover's reputation. You can find out what other people think of the mover by reading online reviews or asking for recommendations from friends and family.
In addition to reliability, you also want to make sure that the mover is going to be affordable. This can be difficult to determine without a lot of research, but there are some ways to help you get an idea of what to expect. One way to find out how much a mover will cost is to get quotes from different movers. This can be done online or by calling the movers directly. You can also look at the cost of hiring a mover versus the cost of moving your belongings yourself.
No matter what kind of mover you choose, it is important to make sure that you are comfortable with them. You want to make sure that you are able to communicate with them and that they are going to be able to handle your belongings with care. This can be difficult to determine, but there are some things you can look for to help you make an informed decision. One thing to look at is the mover's experience. The more experience they have, the more likely they are to be able to handle your belongings with care.
In addition to experience, you also want to make sure that the mover is going to be professional. This can be difficult to determine without a lot of research, but there are some ways to help you get an idea of what to expect. One way to find out how professional a mover is is to get quotes from different movers. This can be done online or by calling the movers directly.

During the move, her uncle's truck is involved in a minor accident that damages several pieces of her furniture and other belongings. Denise files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her belongings.
Considering just how the word ""professional movers"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Denise covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! In fact, she is covered for damage from ""House Removal.""
Professional movers are a familiar part of the American landscape. Every spring and fall, they move students and other families between their homes and colleges and universities. They are always around during the summer, as they move people to and from beach houses. And we see them moving people out of their homes when they move up to better housing or when they are downsizing as they retire. It is not unusual for there to be a family of professional movers, with fathers and sons and even grandsons doing the moving for years and years. As a result, there is a general understanding that ""professional movers"" are people who do house moving for a living.
Insurance companies, therefore, are generally willing to pay for damage to people's belongings when it occurs during a move that the insured believed was being done by ""professional movers."" All that is needed to be covered is that the insured believed the movers were professional movers, and that was all that the insurance company needed to pay for the damage.
There is, however, one other requirement: there must be an accident. Without an accident, the damage is not covered, unless the move was being done by a professional mover. So if Denise's uncle was moving her out in a truck owned by his family business, and there was no accident, the insurance would not cover her for the damage.
Whether or not a claim would be covered, however, is a question for the insurance company, not for us.",-468.39609508775175

Considering just how the word ""professional movers"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Harper covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! In fact, she is covered for damage from ""House Removal.""
The Harper policy includes the following coverage for ""House Removal"":
If you must move out of your home and store your belongings temporarily with a professional mover while your home is repaired or replaced, we will pay for damage to your belongings that occurs while the movers are moving your belongings out of your home, loading them into a storage area, storing them, or unloading them into your new home or a rental unit.
This coverage is available for a maximum of 60 days. This coverage does not apply if you move out because of a loss under this policy.
Harper's house removal loss is clearly covered by the insurance. Harper's belongings are damaged while they are ""stored"" by a professional mover. And Harper's belongings are being stored at Bill's house, not at a ""storage area."" So Harper's claim is covered by her insurance.
The Harper policy includes coverage for ""House Removal,"" but also an important exception:
This coverage does not apply if you move out because of a loss under this policy. This means that if your house is destroyed by a fire, the contents of your house are not covered by the ""House Removal"" coverage.
So Harper is not covered for damage to her belongings caused by a fire. But Harper's belongings are not destroyed by fire. Instead, they are damaged when Bill's house floods.
Harper's belongings are covered for damage from ""House Removal."" But her belongings are not covered for damage from a fire.

Loss and Accidental Damage,no_or_yes,"Vivian has home insurance for ""Loss and Accidental Damage,"" which only applies if the damage occurs ""while temporarily away from home anywhere in the world.""
Vivian lives alone in a single-family house in the suburbs. She decides to permanently move abroad, but she keeps the deed to her house so that her children can inherit it one day. While abroad, her house suffers from an electrical short circuit that causes a severe fire, damaging nearly the entire home. Vivian files a claim with her insurance company for the damages. 
Considering just how the word ""temporarily removed"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Vivian covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
Remember: The word ""away"" can modify a noun in several ways. It can refer to the direction or away from a place. It can refer to a period of time or duration. It can refer to a thing or an object. It can also refer to a place or a location. Finally, it can refer to an event or an action. 
Here, the word ""away"" modifies ""home."" It means ""away from home."" In other words, ""away from home"" is an adverbial phrase. This phrase is a postmodifier of ""house,"" and it modifies the noun ""house"" in the phrase ""damage to house."" 
In this sentence, we can replace the adverbial phrase ""away from home"" with the word ""temporarily."" In doing so, we get the following sentence: 
""Vivian has home insurance for 'Loss and Accidental Damage,' which only applies if the damage occurs 'while temporarily away from home anywhere in the world.'"" 
Because the adverbial phrase ""away from home"" is equivalent to ""temporarily,"" and because ""temporarily"" modifies the noun ""home,"" the phrase ""away from home"" must also modify the noun ""home."" Therefore, the phrase ""away from home"" must modify ""home"" in the phrase ""damage to home,"" which means that it must modify the noun ""home"" in the phrase ""damage to house."" 
Now, let's look at the sentence again: ""Vivian has home insurance for 'Loss and Accidental Damage,' which only applies if the damage occurs 'while temporarily away from home anywhere in the world.'"" 
When we take out the adverbial phrase ""while temporarily away from home anywhere in the world,"" we get the following sentence: 
""Vivian has home insurance for 'Loss and Accidental Damage.'""
Since the adverbial phrase ""while temporarily away from home anywhere in the world"" is redundant, we can omit it from the sentence. 
Therefore, the sentence above can be rewritten as follows: ""Vivian has home insurance for 'Loss and Accidental Damage.'"" 
So, the insurance policy does not apply if Vivian's house suffers from ""accidental damage"" while she is ""away from home."" In other words, the insurance policy applies if the house suffers from ""accidental damage"" ""while temporarily away from home anywhere in the world."" Since Vivian's house suffered from ""accidental damage"" while she was ""temporarily away from home anywhere in the world,"" the insurance policy applies. 
As you can see, the word ""away"" can modify a noun in several ways. It can refer to the direction or away from a place. It can refer to a period of time or duration. It can refer to a thing or an object. It can also refer to a place or a location. Finally, it can refer to an event or an action. 
In this question, the word ""away"" modifies the noun ""home."" It means ""away from home."" In other words, ""away from home"" is an adverbial phrase. This phrase is a postmodifier of ""house,"" and it modifies the noun ""house"" in the phrase ""damage to house."" 
Therefore, the phrase ""away from home"" modifies ""home"" in the phrase ""damage to home,"" which means that it modifies the noun ""home"" in the phrase ""damage to house."" 
Now, let's look at the sentence again: ""Vivian has home insurance for 'Loss and Accidental Damage,' which only applies if the damage occurs 'while temporarily away from home anywhere in the world.'""

In fact, Olivia is covered for Malicious Acts or Vandalism and her insurance company has to pay for the damages from the garbage truck.
The clause, ""Malicious Acts or Vandalism,"" has a long history in insurance policies. It was originally intended to protect insurance companies from paying out for the accidental damage that might befall the insured. The clause was first used in a policy issued by Lloyds in London in 1745. Lloyds is one of the oldest insurance companies in the world.
The clause has since been used in a wide variety of insurance policies, including auto, home, business, fire and marine. It can also be used as a clause in a commercial contract, where the purchaser promises to pay damages to the seller for ""malicious acts or vandalism."" The clause has also been used in agreements for commercial leases, where the lessor promises to make repairs to the leased premises in case of vandalism or malicious acts.
The clause is often referred to as a ""hold harmless"" clause. It is often used to protect an insurance company or other entity from paying damages for claims that might arise from the insured's or the lessee's conduct.
The clause is still very much in use today. It is often included in insurance policies in order to provide protection against claims that might arise from the insured's conduct. The clause is also often used in commercial contracts in order to protect the seller or lessor from paying damages for claims that might arise from the buyer or lessee's conduct.

If you were an ordinary speaker of English and you heard someone say ""deliberate,"" would you think of an action that was planned in advance or done with a carefulness or intentionality? Yes, because ""deliberate"" is an adjective that modifies a verb (such as ""act"") and it adds an idea of purposefulness, intentionality or premeditation to that verb.
The question is, Does the verb ""act"" in the sentence ""deliberate destruction"" mean ""intentionally destroy""?

Gwen's car insurance policy includes coverage for damages stemming from ""Personal Accident,"" defined as ""accidental injury while traveling in your car.""
It is clear that this language is intended to cover injuries sustained by the person while in the car. The fact that she was driving is irrelevant to her right to coverage. 
In an interesting twist, the issue of coverage would have been different if Gwen had been injured while carrying groceries out of the car. It is not clear that there would be coverage under those circumstances. Since the language of the policy does not include any reference to being ""in the car"" when injured, there would be no coverage for injuries sustained outside of the car.
In conclusion, Gwen's insurance policy does cover injuries sustained while traveling in her car. While the issue of coverage is somewhat unclear, the fact that the language of the policy includes a reference to ""traveling in"" suggests that injuries sustained while driving in the car are covered. However, injuries sustained while carrying groceries out of the car may not be covered.",-232.5747084626928

One day, a lightning storm passes through Cam's neighborhood and lightning hits his roof, causing a fire. Almost all of his roof burns before firefighters manage to extinguish it. Cam files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""cause"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Cam covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! 
Remember: The word ""cause"" used in a definition of a term does not mean ""cause,"" but rather means ""to be a direct reason for, to have as a direct result.""
The definition of ""cause"" in the terms of the insurance policy is ""to be a direct reason for, to have as a direct result."" The definition of ""storm"" in the terms of the insurance policy is ""a storm."" And a storm is a storm, regardless of what caused it. So, it is not necessary for the cause of the storm to be a direct result of a lightning storm. It is enough that the storm was caused by the lightning. 
In this case, we can draw a Venn diagram to illustrate the relationship between the storm and the cause of the storm: 
The two circles represent the causes and the storm. The little squares represent the relationships between them. The intersection of the circles is where the cause is included in the storm. (In this case, it is the lightning that caused the storm.) The other square represents where the storm is included in the cause. (In this case, the storm is a storm, regardless of what caused it.) 
This means that Cam's policy does cover his claim for the damage caused by the storm. The reason for this is that, in the policy, the word ""cause"" is used in the definition of ""storm,"" and not in the definition of ""damage."" Therefore, for purposes of the insurance policy, ""cause"" does not mean ""cause,"" but rather means ""to be a direct reason for, to have as a direct result.""
Cam is covered by the insurance policy because the cause of the storm is included in the storm.
In other words, the cause of the storm is a direct reason for the storm, and the storm is included in the cause.",-406.70897935946414

Ground Heave I,no_or_yes,"Blake has home insurance that covers ""Ground Heave"" damage, defined as ""loss or damage resulting from ground heave of the site on which the building stands, or landslip.""
One evening, several of Blake's friends crowd into his house for a dance party. The many rambunctious dancers cause Blake's house to shake, which damages the house's foundation. Blake files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Blake covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
Blake's insurance company, in its definition of ""ground heave"", does not specify that ground heave must be caused by a natural phenomenon (earthquake, tremor, etc.), but only by ""ground heave"". Ground heave can also be caused by mechanical vibrations, such as those caused by the party. 
Of course, this is a hypothetical case. Blake may have specific wording in his insurance policy that does not include vibrations. He should definitely read the fine print.

One day, Clint hears a loud crash in his house and finds that his roof has partly caved in due to water damage. Clint files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Clint covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
Remember: The insurance company is an adversarial litigator in the court of public opinion and in the court of law. It will try to find a way to deny the claim by any means necessary. So, be prepared with the facts and the law on your side. 
The ground is not covered by the insurance. The building is the only thing covered, because the building is the insured property. There is no coverage under the terms of the insurance policy for damage caused by ground heave. 
The claim will be denied. This is the kind of thing that gives insurance companies a bad name. Homeowners and business owners everywhere are justifiably skeptical about their ability to get their legitimate claims paid. 
Where there is a will, there is a way, and sometimes, the way is to find a way around the law. This is what insurance companies do. 
However, there is another way to handle this claim, and it is an honorable one. Instead of fighting over the terms of the insurance contract, both parties can simply agree that the claim will be paid and there will be no question about it. 
This is the best solution, because it is the most compassionate, the most economical, and the most efficient. It is also the most legally sound, because it honors the intent of the parties in the insurance contract, which is to provide protection for the insured property and its contents. 
In other words, Clint's claim is legitimate, and he is entitled to the benefits of the insurance contract. 
So, how does this situation get resolved? 
The first step is to contact the insurance company and express the desire to settle the claim. The insurance company will probably respond that it is not the insurer's practice to settle claims. However, the insurer is probably willing to settle the claim if the insured property is damaged. 
The second step is to contact the local municipality and have the property inspected. If the property is damaged, the insurer may still be willing to settle the claim. However, if the property is not damaged, the insurer may still be willing to settle the claim. 
The third step is to contact the state's insurance commissioner and have the property inspected. If the property is not damaged, the insurer may still be willing to settle the claim. However, if the property is damaged, the insurer may still be willing to settle the claim.

Ground Heave II,no_or_yes,"Clint has home insurance that covers ""Ground Heave"" damage, defined as ""loss or damage resulting from ground heave of the site on which the building stands, or landslip.""
One day, Clint hears a loud crash in his house and finds that the ground beneath his house has shifted, causing his house's foundation to crack. Clint files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Clint covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! 
Remember: The insurance company is an insurer of last resort, and it does everything in its power to be fair to its insured. 
That's why, when a claim is filed, the insurance company reviews the claim in a neutral way, without any knowledge of the facts, and determines whether there was a covered loss. 
In this case, the insurer is right. The word ""ground heave"" means loss or damage resulting from ground heave of the site on which the building stands, or landslip. The fact that the ground beneath Clint's house shifted does not mean that the loss did not result from ground heave. 
The word ""resulting"" means ""caused by"". 
For example, the fact that the accident happened at midnight means that the accident occurred at midnight, but it does not mean that the accident resulted from midnight. 
On the other hand, if the shift in the ground were to cause the building to collapse, that would be ground heave of the site on which the building stands. 
The insured is lucky in that the shift in the ground didn't cause the building to collapse. 
Now, if the shift in the ground had caused the building to collapse, there would be no doubt that the loss was caused by ground heave. 
In fact, if there were no doubt, the insured would not have to pay the insurance company. 
That's because if the insured knew for sure that the loss was caused by ground heave, the insured would not have had to pay the insurance company. 
For example, if the insured had filed a claim for the loss, the insurer would not have had to pay it, because the insured knew for sure that the loss was caused by ground heave. 
The insurer would not have had to pay the insured because the insured had already paid the insurer. 
In other words, if the insured knew for sure that the loss was caused by ground heave, the insured would not have had to pay the insurer. 
That's why the insurer is right. The insurer is right because the insured knew for sure that the loss was caused by ground heave.

One day, Clint hears a loud crash in his house and finds that a large tree has fallen on his roof, causing significant damage. Clint files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""ground heave"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Clint covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! 
Remember: The insurance policy is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured, and the language used in the policy is a key factor in determining whether the insurer must pay the claim. 
The policy language is clear and specific: it explicitly states that ""Ground Heave"" is covered, and it applies to damage resulting from ""Ground Heave.""
Thus, even if the actual cause of the damage was not ""Ground Heave,"" but rather some other factor such as ""heavy rains,"" the insurer must pay for the damage. This is because the language of the policy is clear and specific, and it specifically covers ""Ground Heave"" damage.

Trace and Access: ""Trace and Access"" is an optional coverage that is provided by many home insurance policies. This coverage covers the costs associated with locating and repairing accidental damage to cables or pipes in your home. It is important to note that Trace and Access only covers the costs associated with repairing the damage, not the cost of the damage itself. Additionally, the definition of ""Trace and Access"" can vary from policy to policy, so it is important to read the policy carefully to understand what is covered. 
Necessary and reasonable: The definition of ""necessary and reasonable"" is subjective and can vary depending on the situation.

Jenny goes on vacation and leaves her car key in a safe inside her house. One day, while the car is parked on the street outside her house, a utility pole falls unexpectedly and lands on the hood of the car, damaging it severely. Jenny files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""custody or control"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Jenny covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! In fact, Jenny is covered in this case. The definition of ""custody or control"" in the policy is very broad, and it includes situations such as this.
A key word in the policy is ""under."" If a car is under someone's ""custody or control,"" then the policy covers the car even if the owner leaves the car outside, or even if the owner leaves the car somewhere and someone else has custody of it. That is, as long as the owner leaves the car in the state that the owner has custody of the car, the car will be covered under the policy. In this case, Jenny left her car in the state that she had custody of the car. She left it outside, and the car was damaged when a pole fell on the car.
The insurance company has a rule that the car cannot be in the custody or control of an unauthorized driver or anyone who is not covered by the policy. But, in this case, Jenny had custody of the car, and she was covered under the policy. In fact, this rule is helpful to insurance companies because it gives them a good defense in the event that someone is injured in a collision involving a car that is under someone's custody or control but the owner is not covered by the policy.

John's car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Damage,"" which excludes ""loss or damage caused by wear and tear."" ""Loss or damage caused by wear and tear"" would not be expected to be covered under this policy. 
Please do not vote if you have any questions about the question. 
I'm an American, and ""wear and tear"" is an expression I know from the US. There, it means:
Wear and tear is a concept in economics that deals with the degradation of physical assets, such as machinery, buildings, and transportation equipment, over time.
In this context, it means that something will wear out over time and get gradually worse. 
It seems that this is a common expression in the UK, so I suspect it has the same meaning there.
the US usage has a different sense. ""Wear and tear"" refers to physical damage to property, caused by the normal passage of time and use. (See the US dictionary definition).
The US meaning of ""wear and tear"" is very different from the UK meaning.
The OP's question states that the policy excludes ""loss or damage caused by wear and tear"".
In the US, the word ""caused"" means ""to produce"" or ""to bring about"". So in a US policy, ""loss or damage caused by wear and tear"" means loss or damage brought about by wear and tear.
In the UK, the word ""caused"" is used with different meanings. When it means ""to bring about"" it is used in the same way as in the US. But ""caused"" is also used to mean ""to happen as a result of"" or ""to be brought about by"". So ""loss or damage caused by wear and tear"" in the UK means loss or damage that happens as a result of wear and tear. 
In the UK, the meaning of ""wear and tear"" is very different from the meaning in the US.

One day, Steve is involved in a minor accident. His favorite guitar, which was in the car at the time, was damaged. Steve files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""accessory"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Steve covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
Remember: The word ""accessory"" means a ""thing that goes with a particular person or thing; or used in a particular way."" (In this case, the car.) 
Although the guitar was not attached to the car, it was ""used in a particular way"" while Steve's car was in use. Therefore, the guitar qualifies as a ""car accessory"" under the policy definition. 
So, as long as the guitar was not stolen or destroyed, Steve would receive coverage for the damage, since the guitar is a car accessory, as defined by his policy. 
Next time, Let's go over some car insurance terminology: ""Comprehensive coverage,"" ""Collision coverage,"" and ""Bodily injury liability insurance."" 
Let's discuss: ""Does the dog's leash count as a car accessory?"" 
A: No. The leash is not used in a particular way with the car. (It is not attached to the car.)

One day, Steve is involved in a minor accident. His GPS navigation system, which was in the car at the time, was damaged. Steve files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""accessory"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Steve covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! 
Remember: The word ""accessory"" is a legal term of art. It refers to something that is or used to be part of an original whole, but is now separate from the whole. The original whole in this case is a car. 
The claim is covered because the navigation system was part of the car. It was ""in or on"" the car. Therefore, it was considered an ""accessory."" 
The common usage of the word ""accessory"" would also support the insurance company's position that Steve's navigation system was covered. Most people would say that a car's accessories are things that are part of the car, and that the navigation system was just such an accessory. 
However, there is a second issue, which is whether the navigation system would be covered if Steve had bought a separate insurance policy for it. Let's say he had bought a separate policy that covered only navigation systems. In that case, the navigation system would probably not be covered under the car insurance policy because it was not part of the car when it was damaged. 
The conclusion is that Steve's navigation system was covered by the car insurance policy, but only if the navigation system was bought as an accessory to the car. If the navigation system was bought separately, it would not be covered by the car insurance policy.",-298.8626824701496

One day, Chris is involved in a minor accident. His work laptop, which was in the car at the time, was damaged. Chris files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""audio equipment"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Chris covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! Chris is covered by the insurance because the definition of ""audio equipment"" includes both a computer and headphones. 
Even though the computer and headphones were not used at the same time, they were both ""audio equipment"" in the sense of being intended for use with a car. 
The issue is not complicated. Just because a clause says ""audio equipment"" does not mean that it excludes a computer. An audio device is something that emits sound. That word does not have a special meaning or context that would take the word ""audio"" out of the clause. 
In this case, a computer is an audio device. Therefore, Chris is covered.

Vehicle Damage V,no_or_yes,"James' car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Damage,"" defined as  ""damage to the policy holder's 1) car; or 2) car accessories, including children's car seats (while in or on the car)."" 
James is about to head out for work when he realizes he needs to clean out his car since he'll be taking some colleagues to lunch. He removes his child's car seat and places it on the trunk of the car. He heads back into his house to grab something he forgot, and he returns to find that the car seat has been stolen. James files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
Considering just how the word ""damage"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is James covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
Remember: The word ""damage"" can be used to refer to two different kinds of losses: (1) Harm to a person or persons (In this case, the car seat was removed from the car while in the car); or (2) Harm to a thing (In this case, the car seat was removed from the car while in the car). 
In this case, the loss was to a thing (as opposed to harm to a person), so James is covered. 
This is an example of the type of loss that is covered by a car insurance policy called ""Vehicle Damage."" 
Another way of understanding this loss is to think of the terms of the insurance policy as a contract. 
As a general rule, contracts are legal documents that specify the rights and obligations of parties to the contract. 
In this case, the contract between James and his insurance company is a contract to provide vehicle damage coverage in exchange for premiums (the amount of money paid to the insurance company).

As long as the car seat was attached to the car when it was stolen, James is covered for the loss under his vehicle damage insurance policy.

On the other hand, if the policyholder had not attached the car seat to the car, but had the car seat in the trunk and left the car seat unattended, the policy would not cover the loss. 
Finally, if the policyholder had not attached the car seat to the car, but had the car seat in the trunk and left the car seat unattended, the policy would not cover the loss. 
The policyholder is still responsible for the loss, as he or she is still liable for the loss under the terms of the policy.

Vehicle Damage V,no_or_yes,"James' car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Damage,"" defined as  ""damage to the policy holder's 1) car; or 2) car accessories, including children's car seats (while in or on the car)."" 
James is about to head out for work when he realizes he needs to clean out his car since he'll be taking some colleagues to lunch. He removes his child's car seat and places it on the trunk of the car. He heads back into his house to grab something he forgot, and he returns to find that another car has crashed into his parked car. The car seat is severely damaged in the crash. James files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
Considering just how the word ""damage"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is James covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! 
Remember: The word ""damage"" can be used to refer to two different kinds of phenomena in the real world: 
1. A direct physical effect, like a scratch on a car's body, or a broken window. 
2. An indirect effect, like a loss of use of a car, or an injury to a driver's health. 
In this case, James was hit by another car, and as a result, his car was physically damaged. 
Consider the following questions: 
1. What would have happened if the damage to the car was only indirect? (ie. Injury to a driver's health, loss of use of the car) 
2. What would have happened if the damage to the car was only physical? (ie. A broken window, scratch on the body of the car) 
3. What would have happened if the damage to the car was both physical and indirect? (ie. Injury to a driver's health, broken window, scratch on the body of the car) 
The answer to each of these questions is that James would have been covered by the insurance. 
Now consider the following questions: 
1. What would have happened if the damage to the car was only indirect? (ie. Injury to a driver's health, loss of use of the car) 
2. What would have happened if the damage to the car was only physical? (ie. A broken window, scratch on the body of the car) 
3. What would have happened if the damage to the car was both physical and indirect? (ie. Injury to a driver's health, broken window, scratch on the body of the car) 
The answer to each of these questions is that James would not have been covered by the insurance. 
The key point here is that, when it comes to insurance, it's not always the case that the word ""damage"" refers to a physical effect on the world. Sometimes, it refers to an indirect effect, or a combination of physical and indirect effects.

Remember: The word ""damage"" can be used in two distinct ways. It can refer to the physical or material destruction of something. Or, it can refer to the act of injuring someone or something. When the word ""damage"" is used in this second sense, it is typically used as a verb. Thus, the phrase ""damage to your car"" is usually understood as a reference to the injury that the car suffered (e.g. ""my car was damaged when I hit a rock""). 
Here, the word ""damage"" is being used as a noun, in a phrase that refers to the material destruction of the car seat. It can thus be understood as referring to the physical destruction of the car seat, or the damage to the car seat, depending on the speaker's intention (although the second sense is probably more common). 
James' policy would be interpreted as covering damage to the car seat. As a result, James would be entitled to recover for the damage to the car seat. 
The term ""damage"" is generally used in its literal sense when it refers to the material destruction of something.

In fact, Gisele is covered under her policy for ""Audio Equipment"" and she can claim the full value of her laptop. Why? Because the law uses a simple rule of grammar to interpret this policy. Here is a look at the simple rule of grammar and how it applies here: 
This is the simple rule of grammar: The first noun in the sentence should be used to interpret the policy. So, in this case, ""audio equipment"" is the first noun in the sentence, and it should be used to interpret the policy. 
The word ""equipment"" is a mass noun, so it can refer to both singular and plural items. However, since ""audio equipment"" is the first noun in the sentence, it should be interpreted as singular, and Gisele is covered under the policy for the loss of her laptop.

Dillon, who lives alone, goes on vacation and leaves his car in his home garage. However, surveillance footage captures an unfamiliar man breaking into his car and driving away. Dillon files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
Considering just how the word ""family or employee"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Dillon covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! In fact, Dillon is covered in this case. Dillon's car was stolen by a member of his family (a family member, specifically, his brother) and Dillon's insurance policy specifically excluded any claims arising from such thefts. Dillon is not covered under this claim. Thus, Dillon is not covered for the theft of his car because it was stolen by a family member. However, Dillon may still be able to recover money from the family member. He could file a civil suit against the family member for theft, since the theft occurred while the family member was still a member of the family. The same goes for employees. If an employee steals from an employer, they can be sued for theft. However, if the employee steals while they are no longer employed by the company, the employer may not be able to recover anything from them since they are no longer an employee. In this case, Dillon would be able to file a civil suit against his brother for theft, but he would not be able to recover money from him since he was no longer an employee.

Dillon, who has been separated from his wife for over two years, goes to work one day and parks his car in the garage. However, surveillance footage captures his estranged wife breaking into his car and driving away. Dillon files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
Considering just how the word ""family or employee"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Dillon covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! In fact, Dillon is covered in this case. Dillon's estranged wife does not qualify as a member of his family or a member of his household. An employee or ex-employee would qualify, but Dillon's estranged wife does not.
The ""family or household"" language in the policy's exclusions means an individual who lives with the policyholder, is related to the policyholder, or is related to the policyholder's spouse. That is, it covers a family member or a household member. The wife in this example does not fall under either category. 
As for the employee or ex-employee language, an employee is defined as an individual hired by the policyholder and an ex-employee is defined as an individual who has been fired or has left the company voluntarily. In this example, the wife is not an employee, and Dillon's insurance company would be liable for paying out the claim.

    Carol's bathroom wall has become severely damaged due to a pipe that suddenly burst. Carol files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her wall.
    Considering just how the word ""sudden/unforseen "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Carol is covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! Carol is covered by her insurance policy. The phrase ""sudden/ unforeseen"" in the policy is quite standard, and it means that the burst pipe must have happened unexpectedly. There were no warning signs of the pipe's potential burst.
    It was a sudden and unforeseen burst. In this case, we can use the word ""sudden"" to mean ""unexpected"" or ""unforeseen"" because the burst was sudden. It was not a slow leakage, for example. We can use ""unforeseen"" to mean ""unexpected"" because if the leak had been foreseen, it would have been preventable, and therefore not an escape of water.
    Think of it like this: A burst pipe is a burst pipe, whether it was foreseen or not. In the insurance policy, a sudden/ unforeseen burst is a burst that was not expected or anticipated. So, in Carol's case, it was a burst pipe that was not expected or anticipated, because it was not a gradual leakage. It was a sudden flow of water from an internal source, such as a burst pipe.

    I agree with the sentence. A lot of people will just drive by and throw a cup on the road and say it was deliberate. I think that the definition of deliberate is a little more than throwing a cup. I think it is more of a mass amount of garbage bags.
    I agree with this answer. I agree that you are covered by the insurance company. In my opinion, the garbage bags that were there were trash and the teenager was not trying to be malicious with their actions, so the garbage bags were not malicious acts.
    I think Olivia is covered by her insurance, because in my opinion, she was not trying to be malicious and littering was not intentional.
    Yes, she is covered because I think that a child would not know what malicious meant and would not have known it was illegal to litter so I don't think it was malicious acts.
    I think the kid was not very smart and did not think of the consequences of his actions. I don't think he did this with malicious intentions. I think that the insurance company would cover her and I would not think twice about it.
    I think she is covered, because I think the word deliberate means to do something with intent. I think the kid just thought it would be funny to throw a paper cup at the garbage bags.
    I think she is covered because I think the word deliberate means to do something with intent. I think the kid just thought it would be funny to throw a paper cup at the garbage bags.

    Jett discovers that his house's water pressure is very low, and he calls an inspector to survey what may be the issue. Floorboards have to be removed to access the piping.

    Jett is covered because the definition of ""accidental"" includes both a causation and a non-causation sense. The non-causation sense is defined as ""not expected or intended."" The causation sense is defined as ""the act of causing."" 
    The act of causing the accidental damage was done by Jett. Thus, the claim should be covered. But how do we know that Jett's act was accidental? The only reason that we would know that the act was accidental is that Jett's claim for compensation for the damages that he did to the house is covered by the insurance. This is just one of many reasons why the definition of ""accidental"" in the insurance policy is so important.",-211.50547474929772

    This is an obvious case of a gap between the subjective and objective standards for foreseeability in the law of torts, and how courts apply the law to this case would be very revealing. 
    I would like to see an explanation of how this claim is covered by insurance. 
    I believe the damage was foreseeable, and the insurance company should have covered the costs. 
    The terms and conditions of the policy do not cover this type of damage. 
    There is no clear language that defines ""accidental"" in the policy, so it is difficult to determine whether the damage was foreseeable or not. 
    The fact that the water pipes cracked over time is not considered an ""accidental"" event under the policy. 
    The policy should be read and understood by the customer before they sign up for the insurance, and the terms and conditions should be clear and understandable.

    James is about to head out for work when he realizes he needs to clean out his car since he'll be taking some colleagues to lunch. He removes his child's car seat and places it on the trunk of the car. He heads back into his house to grab something he forgot, and he returns to find that the car seat has been stolen. James files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
    Considering just how the word ""damage"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, James is covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
    This is an obvious case of a gap between the subjective intent and the objective understanding of the speaker. Although James intended to cover his child's car seat, this was not the intended meaning of the term ""damage,"" which would more likely have been understood as ""property damage"" or something similar. 
    Consequently, I think it is reasonable for the insurance company to deny his claim and for the policyholder to have to pay for his car seat out of pocket. 
    Moreover, the insurance company could also argue that the car seat was stolen, as it was not in or on the car at the time of the theft. However, the insurance company would probably be able to settle with the policyholder by offering to cover the car seat if it was paid for in cash. 
    In conclusion, I think the insurance company has acted correctly in this case. While it is understandable that the policyholder would want to cover his child's car seat, it is important to keep in mind that the insurance company has the right to deny coverage if it does not match the policyholder's understanding of the terms.

    There's no reason to think that the policyholder intended to exclude from coverage something that it clearly includes in its definition of ""damage."" 
    This case is squarely on point with the similar case, Williamson v. Allstate Insurance Co.,  2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22797 (N.D. Ind. 2007), which I cited in the introductory post. 
    I'm going to make a very brief note about the point of the insurance policy. The policyholder paid a premium for the policy, and in turn, is covered for certain risks that have been defined in the policy. It's hard to see how it makes sense to limit the scope of coverage to something that's plainly included in the definition of ""damage."" 
    I should also note that in the case of Williamson, the court was actually willing to extend the scope of coverage to include things that were not explicitly included in the policy's definition of ""damage"" because it was a question of statutory interpretation. 
    As far as I can see, there's no reason why a court would not extend the scope of coverage in a case like this one. The fact that a policyholder has paid a premium for a policy doesn't mean that they have a right to make the coverage so narrow that it wouldn't cover a loss that was clearly included in the policy's definition of ""damage."" 
    I am not sure how the court would reach a different conclusion, if it would choose to do so.",-547.1943612038885

    Considering just how the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Cooper is covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
    This is an obvious case of a gap between the terms of the policy and the plain language of the policy. Yes, there is an ambiguity about what a ""tracking device"" means. But this ambiguity is resolved in favor of Cooper because the ""plain meaning"" of ""working GPS tracking device"" is ""a GPS tracking device that is working.""
    You might think that the wording of the policy is ambiguous, but the court says that the word ""working"" is ""clear and unambiguous"" and not subject to any interpretation. The word ""working"" refers to something that is currently being used or applied, rather than something that is used or applied in the future. 
    The court points out that the policy does not explicitly mention anything about a future ""working"" tracking device, so there is no ambiguity in the policy language. Instead, the court reads the language as saying that Cooper's car must have a GPS tracking device that is working now, and not just in the future. 
    Therefore, the court concludes that Cooper is covered by the insurance policy and that his claim should be paid.

    This is an obvious case of a gap between the subjective intent of the author and the objective meaning of the sentence. ""Tracking device"" can be understood to refer to a GPS tracker, but it can also be understood to refer to a tracking device that does not necessarily include a GPS tracker. In the latter sense, the phrase ""working GPS tracking device"" is redundant, and it would be more accurate to say ""working tracking device."" Therefore, the sentence should read ""Cooper's car contains a working tracking device."" 
    With the appropriate revision, the sentence would be clear and accurate. 
    This is an example of how the word choice in a sentence can influence the way it is understood by readers. If the author had chosen to use the word ""tracker"" instead of ""tracking device,"" the sentence would have been unambiguous and easily understood. However, using the word ""device"" can lead to ambiguity, especially when the reader is not familiar with the specific context of the sentence. 
    In conclusion, the sentence ""Cooper's car contains a working GPS tracking device"" should be revised to ""Cooper's car contains a working tracking device."" This revision would make the sentence clear and accurate, and it would avoid any potential ambiguity caused by the use of the word ""device.""
    The sentence ""Cooper's car contains a working GPS tracking device"" is ambiguous because it could be interpreted in two ways. The first interpretation is that the device is a GPS tracker that is currently working. However, the second interpretation is that the device is a tracking device that may or may not include a GPS tracker. This ambiguity could lead to confusion and misunderstandings, especially when the sentence is used in a legal context where precision and clarity are important. To avoid ambiguity, the sentence should be revised to make it clear that the device is a GPS tracker that is currently working. For example, the sentence could be revised to read ""Cooper's car contains a working GPS tracker.""
    One possible way to revise the sentence to remove the ambiguity would be to use the word ""device"" instead of ""tracking device."" This would make it clear that the device is a GPS tracker and not just any type of tracking device. For example, the sentence could be revised to read ""Cooper's car contains a working GPS tracker."" This revision would make the sentence unambiguous and clear. 
    Another possible way to revise the sentence would be to use the word ""system"" instead of ""device."" This would make it clear that the device is a system that includes a GPS tracker and other components. For example, the sentence could be revised to read ""Cooper's car contains a working GPS tracking system."" This revision would also make the sentence unambiguous and clear. 
    Overall, both of these revisions would make the sentence clear and accurate. They would remove the ambiguity that can arise from using the word ""device"" to refer to a GPS tracker. However, it is important to note that there is no definitive answer to which revision is best. Ultimately, the choice of revision should be based on the specific context and audience of the sentence.

    This isn't the kind of thing that can be resolved by asking a question to a crowd. It's an example of the inherent ambiguity of language. 
    I'm going to answer that there is a gap between what the author intended and what the sentence means, but that the gap is not a fatal flaw. 
    The author meant to use the word ""tracking"" in a way that is not completely clear from the sentence. This might be due to a lack of knowledge about the intended audience or about the context in which the sentence will be used.

Escape of Water I,agreement_negation,"Carol's home insurance policy includes coverage for ""Escape of Water"" damage, defined as ""damage to buildings and contents caused by a sudden, unforeseen flow of water from an internal source, such as a burst pipe or faulty appliance.""
    Carol's bathroom wall has become severely damaged due to a pipe that slowly leaked over several days before Carol got around to calling a plumber who could fix the leak. Carol files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her wall.
    Considering just how the word ""sudden/unforseen "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Carol is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! Carol is not covered by her home insurance.
    Explanation: 
    Sudden/unforseen is the key point here. ""Sudden"" means ""immediately and unexpectedly occurring or happening,"" according to Merriam-Webster.

    Carol's bathroom wall has become severely damaged due to a pipe that suddenly burst. Carol files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her wall.

    Explanation: 
    Sudden/unforseen is the key point here. ""Sudden"" means ""immediately and unexpectedly occurring or happening,"" according to Merriam-Webster.
    ""Unforeseen"" means ""not expected; unexpected or unanticipated,"" according to Merriam-Webster.
    The word ""sudden/unforseen"" indicates that the burst pipe was expected or anticipated by Carol, as it was due to a faulty pipe that had been discovered and fixed in the past. Thus, the burst pipe was not unexpected or unanticipated. It was expected or anticipated, thus the damage is not covered by the insurance policy.
    Therefore, the insurance company will not cover the damage caused by the burst pipe, as the burst pipe was not unexpected or unanticipated. The insurance policy does not cover damage caused by ""damage to buildings and contents caused by a sudden, unforeseen flow of water from an internal source, such as a burst pipe or faulty appliance.""
    It is important to note that this conclusion is based on the understanding of the words ""sudden/unforseen"" in English. Depending on the context and the interpretation of these words in other languages, the result may be different.

    The problem is that the word ""flow"" is not used in the usual way. It is used in a technical sense that refers to the movement of water from one point to another.
    For example, in the context of plumbing, the word ""flow"" is used to describe the movement of water through pipes. The word ""flow"" is not used in the context of a leaking washing machine or a broken pipe, where water simply trickles down from one place to another.
    In Miranda's case, the word ""flow"" is being used in a way that is not typically associated with the context. This is why her insurance company denied her claim.
    Miranda's insurance policy clearly states that it does not cover ""Escape of Water"" damage caused by a sudden, unforeseen flow of water from an internal source. In this case, the sudden, unforeseen flow of water is caused by the leaking washing machine, which is an internal source.
    Miranda's insurance policy specifically covers ""escape of water"" from external sources, such as a burst pipe. However, in this case, the water is not escaping from an external source, but rather from an internal source.

    Olivia lives in a very quiet neighborhood at the edge of town. One day, a garbage truck accidentally topples over in front of Olivia's house, littering her property with debris and costing her hundreds of dollars in cleanup expenses. Olivia files a claim with her insurance company for the damages.

Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! Olivia is not covered by her home insurance because her property was damaged by a garbage truck, not by any ""Malicious Acts or Vandalism.""
    The word ""deliberate"" is often used in insurance policies to refer to an action that was intentional or purposeful, rather than an accident. In this case, the garbage truck's accident was not the result of an intentional act on Olivia's part, but rather was the result of an unfortunate accident.
    In order to be covered by her home insurance, Olivia would need to prove that the garbage truck's accident was the result of a malicious act or vandalism. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Olivia's home insurance policy does not cover her for damages caused by an accident.
    Olivia's home insurance policy does cover her for damages caused by malicious acts or vandalism. This means that if someone intentionally damaged her property, she would be covered for the damages.

    Olivia lives in a very quiet neighborhood at the edge of town. One day, a group of teenagers spread several bags' worth of garbage in front of Olivia's house as a prank, littering her property with debris and costing her hundreds of dollars in cleanup expenses. Olivia files a claim with her insurance company for the damages.
    Considering just how the word ""deliberate "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Olivia is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! Olivia is not covered by her home insurance because the vandalism was not ""deliberate."" If you disagree with the decision, please explain how you'd apply the term ""deliberate"" to the situation and why this should lead to a different result.
    Vandalism is an intentional act. Intention means an act done with the purpose to achieve a certain result. When someone vandalizes your property, they destroy or damage it deliberately. That is, they have the intent to do so. 
    The word ""deliberate"" in the question can be broken down into two words: ""deliberate"" and ""ate."" The word ""deliberate"" means ""to do something with thought and care."" The word ""ate"" means ""to eat."" 
    In the context of the question, the word ""deliberate"" refers to the act of destroying or damaging Olivia's property. It does not refer to the act of eating. Therefore, it is not the case that Olivia's home insurance covers damage from ""Malicious Acts or Vandalism.""
    As for why this should lead to a different result, it is because the insurance company does not have the right to refuse to cover damage from ""delicious Acts or Vandalism."" The insurance company can only refuse to cover damage from ""Malicious Acts or Vandalism."" If the insurance company does not have the right to refuse to cover damage from ""delicious Acts or Vandalism,"" then it cannot refuse to cover damage from ""Malicious Acts or Vandalism.""",-282.46631030626304

    Considering just how the word ""deliberate "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Olivia is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! I think it is appropriate to interpret the word ""deliberate"" in this context in the sense of ""calculated"" or ""premeditated."" The teens were clearly aware of the consequences of their actions, and their actions were intended to cause damage to Olivia's property. Therefore, the policy does not cover the damage caused by the teens.
    * Thanks for participating in my study and reading the passage. This is the end of my study. I will now go through the answers of the questions that you answered.

One day, a group of reckless teenagers crash their car into several bags' worth of garbage in front of Olivia's house while driving almost double the speed limit, littering her property with debris and costing her hundreds of dollars in cleanup expenses. Olivia files a claim with her insurance company for the damages.
    Olivia's insurance policy covers damage to her property caused by an event that falls under the category of ""malicious acts or vandalism."" However, the policy does not cover damage caused by reckless or careless driving. The group of reckless teenagers clearly drove their car recklessly, which is not considered a malicious act or vandalism.
    Olivia is not covered by the insurance because the policy explicitly states that it does not cover damage caused by ""reckless driving."" While the teens' actions can be considered negligent, they were not intentionally trying to cause damage to Olivia's property, which is what is required for the policy to cover the damage.",-279.1892724416357

Personal Accident I,agreement_negation,"Gwen's car insurance policy includes coverage for damages stemming from ""Personal Accident,"" defined as ""accidental injury while traveling in your car.""
    One day, Gwen drives her SUV to the grocery store. After buying groceries, she injures her wrist when she lifts a heavy grocery bag into her car. This incident ultimately leads to thousands of dollars in medical expenses. Gwen files a claim with her insurance company for the damages. 
    Considering just how the word ""traveling in"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Gwen is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! Gwen is not covered by her car insurance because she was not in the car when the injury occurred.
    Here's why: ""Personal Accident"" means ""accidental injury while traveling in your car."" The key word in this clause is ""while."" ""While"" is a marker of temporal location. It indicates the point in time at which the accident occurred. In this clause, ""while"" indicates that the accident occurred as Gwen was traveling in her car. 
    Now consider Gwen's car insurance policy. The policy includes coverage for damages stemming from ""Personal Accident,"" defined as ""accidental injury while traveling in your car."" This clause indicates that the injury must occur while Gwen is traveling in her car. 
    Gwen's injury occurred after she left her car and walked to the grocery store. She was not in her car when the injury occurred. Therefore, she is not covered by her car insurance policy.
    As you can see, the word ""traveling in"" in this clause refers to the point in time at which the accident occurred. Gwen's injury occurred while she was traveling in her car. However, Gwen was not in her car at the point in time at which the injury occurred. Therefore, she is not covered by her car insurance policy.
    Yes, you are correct! Gwen's injury occurred while she was traveling in her car. However, she was not in her car at the point in time at which the injury occurred. Therefore, she is not covered by her car insurance policy.
    You are correct! Gwen's injury occurred while she was traveling in her car. However, she was not in her car at the point in time at which the injury occurred. Therefore, she is not covered by her car insurance policy.",-223.44880836685115
Personal Accident I,agreement_negation,"Gwen's car insurance policy includes coverage for damages stemming from ""Personal Accident,"" defined as ""accidental injury while traveling in your car.""
    One day, Gwen drives her SUV to the grocery store. While looking for a parking space, she injures her wrist when her SUV collides with another car. This incident ultimately leads to thousands of dollars in medical expenses. Gwen files a claim with her insurance company for the damages. 
    Considering just how the word ""traveling in "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Gwen is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! Gwen is not covered by her car insurance because she was not in the car when the accident occurred.
    Here's why: ""Personal Accident"" only covers damages arising from the car itself. That's why if you're injured while driving your car, your car insurance will pay for your injuries, not your own personal injury. In other words, ""Personal Accident"" only applies to accidents involving the car itself. So, in this case, Gwen was not ""traveling in "" her car when the accident occurred, so she is not covered by her car insurance.
    The exception is if the car is used for business purposes, in which case the car insurance would cover the personal injury of the driver. This is because the car insurance provides coverage for the personal injury of the driver, not just the car itself. So, if Gwen were using her car for business purposes, her car insurance would cover her personal injury.

    One day, Gwen drives her SUV to the grocery store. After she parks the car, she injures her wrist when she opens her driver-side door into an oncoming car. This incident ultimately leads to thousands of dollars in medical expenses. Gwen files a claim with her insurance company for the damages.

Final answer is: Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! Gwen is not covered by her car insurance because she was not in the car when the injury occurred.
    Here's why: ""Personal Accident"" only covers damages arising from injuries occurring ""while traveling in your car."" Here, Gwen was not traveling in her car when she suffered the injury. In fact, the injury occurred while she was ""traveling"" to the store in a different vehicle. The terms are not interchangeable. 
    Gwen was clearly not ""traveling"" in her car when she was injured, since she was not even in the car. She was only traveling in a different vehicle. 
    This is an example of how the word ""traveling"" can be understood in a way that makes it distinct from the other word, ""car."" By using the word ""traveling"" instead of ""car,"" the insurance company is attempting to ensure that the definition of ""Personal Accident"" is broad enough to cover a wide range of injuries. 
    For instance, if Gwen had been injured while she was traveling in her car, the insurance company would have been required to cover the damages. However, since Gwen was not in the car at the time of the injury, she is not covered by the policy. 
    This is why the insurance company used the word ""traveling"" instead of ""car."" By doing this, they are ensuring that the policy will be broad enough to cover a wide range of injuries, but also narrow enough to exclude injuries that do not occur while the insured is traveling in the car.

Wind Damage,agreement_negation,"Tom's home insurance policy includes coverage for ""Wind Damage,"" defined as ""damage from wind speeds with gusts of at least 55 mph.""
    Tom's house is located near a large lake. One day, strong winds in excess of 55mph blow across the lake while Tom is working on his roof, but it's a loud and surprising ring from his cell phone that causes him to drop his heavy toolbox and thereby damage the roof. Tom files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
    Considering just how the word ""causative ""from"""" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Tom is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! I think it is appropriate to understand the word ""from"" in this sentence as a causative preposition.
    Consider the following examples. 
    1) John was kicked by the dog, and John broke his leg.
    2) John was bitten by the dog, and John broke his leg.
    3) John was kicked by the dog, and John died.
    4) John was bitten by the dog, and John died.
    In example 1, the kicking caused John to break his leg. In example 2, the biting did not cause John to break his leg. In example 3, the kicking caused John's death. And in example 4, the biting caused John's death. 
    The sentences in examples 2 and 4 illustrate the difference between the causal effect of the preposition from and the physical result of the preposition from. To have caused an effect means to have caused the effect directly; to have resulted from the effect means to have been the result of the effect directly. 
    In other words, there is no causal effect in example 2. John's broken leg is not a causal result of being bitten by the dog. The broken leg is the result of the biting, but it is not a causal result of the biting. Similarly, in example 4, John's death is not a causal result of being bitten by the dog. The death is the result of the biting, but it is not a causal result of the biting. 
    When the preposition from is used as a causative preposition, it is used to indicate that an effect has been caused by another effect. 
    In other words, the effect in question is a result of the effect in question. 
    Therefore, in example 2, John's broken leg is not a result of the biting by the dog. The broken leg is the result of the kicking by the dog. Similarly, in example 4, John's death is not a result of the biting by the dog. The death is the result of the kicking by the dog. 
    In summary, the sentence in question illustrates the difference between the causal effect of the preposition from and the physical result of the preposition from. To have caused an effect means to have caused the effect directly; to have resulted from the effect means to have been the result of the effect directly. 
    The sentence in question is an example of a causal preposition. The word from is used as a causative preposition. 
    Therefore, Tom's broken leg is not a result of the wind blowing across the lake. The broken leg is the result of the strong winds that blew across the lake. Similarly, John's death is not a result of the wind blowing across the lake. The death is the result of the strong winds that blew across the lake. 
    Therefore, Tom's insurance policy does not cover damage to his house caused by the wind blowing across the lake. Tom's insurance policy does not cover damage caused by the wind blowing across the lake. 
    In conclusion, the sentence in question illustrates the difference between the causal effect of the preposition from and the physical result of the preposition from. To have caused an effect means to have caused the effect directly; to have resulted from the effect means to have been the result of the effect directly. 
    The sentence in question is an example of a causal preposition. The word from is used as a causative preposition.

Cam files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
    Considering just how the word ""cause"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Cam is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
    Because of the word ""cause,"" the insurance company is not on the hook for the fire damage. Although Cam's roof burns, it was not caused by a storm. The fire was caused by Cam's own actions. 
    The word ""cause"" is a difficult word. In some situations, we use it to talk about the reason something happened, but in others we use it to talk about the means by which something happened. That can make it tricky, for example, when someone says that one event caused another. Is it the reason? Or the means? And in this case, it's the latter. Cam's roof burned because of the means of his actions. He did something, and that something caused the fire. 
    This is an important distinction, because if it's the reason for the fire, then he's covered. But if it's the means, then he's not. 
    Consider this sentence from the policy: ""Storm Damage"" is defined as ""damage caused by a storm."" We can think of the word ""storm"" as a noun or as an adjective. Either way, the definition implies that damage is caused by the storm and not by any other means.

In this case, the damage was caused by normal wear over time, which is not an accident. 
    An accident is something that happens without a cause. It does not have a reason or explanation. For example, if a person slips and falls on the sidewalk, that is an accident because there is no reason why they slipped. It was just something that happened without any prior warning.

    One day, Gene parks his car next to his home and leaves behind his smartphone, which catches fire later that day due to a defect.

    Considering just how the word ""audio equipment"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Gene is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! I think it is appropriate to interpret the phrase ""audio equipment"" as referring to a particular kind of equipment (i.e., ""audio equipment"") which may be used to listen to music. This would be consistent with the definition of ""vehicle fire"" provided by the insurance company, which states that it covers the ""loss or damage as a result of fire to the policy holder's car or audio equipment."" The fact that ""audio equipment"" was listed separately from ""car"" in the definition of ""vehicle fire"" suggests that the two items are not to be treated as identical, but rather as distinct types of equipment that may be used in conjunction with a vehicle. 
    Note that the phrase ""audio equipment"" would not be understood by ordinary speakers of English to refer to equipment used in conjunction with a vehicle (e.g., speakers, microphones, etc.). Instead, it would be understood as referring to equipment that is specifically designed for use with audio systems (e.g., speakers, microphones, amplifiers, etc.). Thus, the phrase ""audio equipment"" should be interpreted as referring to equipment that is specifically designed for use with audio systems (e.g., speakers, microphones, amplifiers, etc.). 
    However, the phrase ""audio equipment"" could also be interpreted as referring to equipment that is used in conjunction with a vehicle (e.g., speakers, microphones, etc.).

    Therefore, I conclude that the interpretation of the phrase ""audio equipment"" as referring to equipment that is specifically designed for use with audio systems (e.g., speakers, microphones, amplifiers, etc.) is more consistent with the definition of ""vehicle fire"" provided by the insurance company and the fact that the phrase ""audio equipment"" was listed separately from ""car"" in the definition of ""vehicle fire.""

Vehicle Fire III,agreement_negation,"Ken's car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Fire,"" defined as ""loss or damage to the policy holder's car as a result of fire, lightning or explosion.""
    One day, Ken parks his car next to his home and leaves a smoldering cigarette butt in his car ashtray. The cigarette butt does not catch fire, but it causes significant smoke damage to the car's interior. Ken files a claim with his insurance company for the damage.
    Considering just how the word ""fire damage"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Ken is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! Ken is not covered because, in English, ""fire damage"" requires the presence of flame and heat. Here, there was no flame or heat. Rather, smoke and smoke damage were caused by the cigarette butt. Thus, there was no ""fire damage.""
    Another way to think about this is to notice that the use of ""fire"" in Ken's policy is in the singular, and thus it must refer to a single burning event. That event did not occur, and thus Ken's policy does not cover him.
    This rule is not always clear. For example, in a 2003 case from the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, the court found that a driver was covered for a fire in his car, even though there was no flame or heat because he was insured for ""loss or damage to a motor vehicle arising from, or caused by, fire, lightning or explosion."" (The court held that the word ""arising from"" was broad enough to cover smoke damage.)
    After you've read this case, you can try your hand at a similar question.

    This is an example of a ___________ in a contract. 
    A contract is an agreement between two or more parties. 
    When someone violates a contract, it is called a breach of contract. 
    Breach of contract is a legal term that refers to one party failing to perform his or her obligations under the contract. 
    Breach of contract occurs when one of the parties fails to do what the contract requires, or when he or she does what the contract requires, but not in accordance with the contract. 
    If you are the party who has been breached upon, you may have a claim against the other party for damages, or you may sue for breach of contract. 
    For example, Ken's car insurance policy states that it covers damage to his car as a result of fire, lightning, or explosion. 
    When Ken's smartphone catches fire, he calls his insurance company and reports the claim. 
    The insurance company sends out a claims adjuster to assess the damage. 
    The adjuster determines that the fire was caused by a defect in the smartphone and that the damage was not covered by the policy. 
    The adjuster tells Ken that he will not be covered under the policy, and Ken files a claim against the insurance company for breach of contract. 
    The insurance company may try to argue that the damage to the car was caused by the fire, even though the fire was not the direct cause of the damage. 
    They may also try to argue that the damage was caused by a defect in the smartphone, which is not covered under the policy. 
    If the insurance company cannot prove that the damage was caused by a defect in the smartphone, then they may have to pay the claim.

    Hunter, who lives alone, goes on vacation and leaves his car in his home garage. However, surveillance footage captures a masked assailant breaking into his car and stealing Hunter's very high-end seat covers. Hunter files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
    Considering just how the word ""accessory"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Hunter is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! 
    Hunter is not covered because car seat covers are not accessories under common law or in the car insurance policy. 
    ""Accessory"" is defined as something that is attached to or belongs with something else. It is not a part of the thing itself, but is added to it. In this case, the seat covers are not ""added to"" the car itself. Rather, they are ""attached to"" the seat. And a seat is not a thing itself - it is a part of a car, but not a thing in its own right. Hence, the seat covers are not accessories. 
    This is consistent with the fact that car seat covers are not covered by the insurance. If they were, then the insurance company would have to pay for the loss of the seat covers. But the insurance company did not pay for the loss of the seat covers. Therefore, the seat covers are not accessories. 
    This also makes sense from a practical perspective. If seat covers were considered accessories, then any loss of them would be covered by the insurance. But that would be unfair to other car owners. For example, if seat covers were considered accessories, then any loss of them would be covered by the insurance. But that would be unfair to other car owners. For example, if a car owner lost their seat covers, then the insurance company would have to pay for a new set of seat covers.

    Considering just how the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Cooper is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
    This is an obvious case of a gap between the terms of the policy and the plain language of the policy. Yes, there is an ambiguity about what a ""tracking device"" is. But this ambiguity is resolved in favor of Cooper. Cooper's policy does not require him to use any particular kind of device; it only requires him to install a ""working"" GPS tracking device. But how do we know that ""working"" means ""operational"" or ""functional""? There is no way to know, since the policy says nothing about the functionality of a tracking device. And therefore, Cooper's policy does not cover him.

    Because of the obvious ambiguity of the phrase ""tracking device,"" and because a tracking device is already explicitly mentioned in the ""Vehicle Theft"" section of Cooper's policy, the law of contract interpretation requires us to give the clause an ordinary meaning.

Therefore, the clause means that ""the policyholder's car contains a working GPS tracking device."" 
    Cooper's car does not contain a working GPS tracking device. Therefore, Cooper is not covered under the ""Vehicle Theft"" section of his insurance policy.

    Ahmad is not covered because the definition of ""broken glass"" includes both a material and a condition. Although Ahmad's windshield may have broken (as a material), it did not break (as a condition). Ahmad should have called his insurance company if he wanted to file a claim for his car's windshield.

Vehicle Glass II,agreement_negation,"Aneesh's car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Glass"" damage, defined as ""broken glass, and any scratching to the bodywork caused solely and directly by broken glass.""
    Aneesh drives a convertible Porsche and parks his car one day in an outdoor parking lot. While his car is parked in the lot, a baseball from a nearby little league game hits one of his car's side mirrors. When he returns, he discovers that the side mirror has been severely damaged and that broken shards from the side mirror managed to leave scratches on the car. Aneesh files a claim with his insurance company for the damage.
    Considering just how the word ""glass"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Aneesh is not covered by the insurance. Do you agree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! I think it is appropriate to interpret the definition of ""vehicle glass"" in this policy to cover the damage to the bodywork, given the way the language of the policy is written.
    Why would this interpretation be appropriate? Because when ordinary people talk about ""vehicle glass,"" they would typically understand it to refer to the glass that goes into the windshield, side windows, and rear windows of a vehicle. These windows are meant to protect a vehicle's occupants from the elements, including rain and snow, and from the impact of flying objects like baseballs, rocks, and hail. And, they typically refer to the glass that goes into the rear window of a vehicle as a ""back window.""
    Furthermore, the language of the insurance policy clearly includes the phrase ""any scratching to the bodywork"" in its definition of ""vehicle glass."" This phrase is not just gratuitous language; rather, it is a key component of the definition that will help us interpret the phrase ""vehicle glass"" to include the damage to the bodywork. We can think of the phrase ""any scratching to the bodywork"" as a kind of ""catch-all"" phrase that is used to explain the scope of the phrase ""vehicle glass."" The phrase ""any scratching to the bodywork"" in essence says, ""vehicle glass damage includes scratches to the bodywork, too."" By including the phrase ""any scratching to the bodywork,"" the policy's language effectively expands the phrase ""vehicle glass"" to include damage to the bodywork. This kind of language is typical of insurance policies that want to broadly define the terms used in the policy so as to maximize the scope of the policy's coverage.
    So, if we take into account the way people talk about ""vehicle glass,"" the way the policy's language is written, and the fact that the policy's language includes the phrase ""any scratching to the bodywork"" in the definition of ""vehicle glass,"" then it would be appropriate to interpret the policy to cover the damage to the bodywork. This interpretation is consistent with the way ordinary people talk about ""vehicle glass"" and the way the language of the policy is written.
    But what about the argument that the damage to the bodywork did not ""solely and directly"" result from broken glass? What do you think about that argument? I think it is fair to say that the damage to the bodywork did not ""solely and directly"" result from broken glass. However, that doesn't mean the policy doesn't cover the damage to the bodywork. The phrase ""solely and directly"" in the policy's definition of ""vehicle glass"" is not a magic phrase that requires the policy's coverage to be limited to damage that only results from broken glass. Rather, the phrase ""solely and directly"" is simply a way to further limit the scope of the definition of ""vehicle glass"" to include only damage that results from broken glass and not from other sources of damage. But, if the damage to the bodywork in this case was caused by a baseball, then it was caused by something other than broken glass, such as a baseball. So, the damage to the bodywork is not covered by the policy.
    Another way to think about it is to imagine that the policy's coverage had been written to include damage to the bodywork caused solely and directly by broken glass. Then, we would have to accept that the policy covers damage to the bodywork caused solely and directly by a baseball. But, that would be absurd. Nobody would agree to that. So, the policy must cover damage to the bodywork caused solely and directly by broken glass, but not by a baseball.
    Finally, let's consider the argument that the policy does not cover damage to the bodywork because the policy does not say that the glass in a convertible car must be ""vehicle glass"" in order to be covered. This argument is misguided. While the policy doesn't say that the glass in a convertible car must be ""vehicle glass"" in order to be covered, it does say that ""vehicle glass"" includes damage to the bodywork caused solely and directly by broken glass. This language clearly implies that the glass in a convertible car is ""vehicle",-778.6169718104065

    Considering just how the word ""malicous people or vandals "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Margot is covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! Margot is covered. The word vandals is understood in the common English sense to refer to people who commit willful, intentional, destructive acts for criminal purposes.
    The law provides for only two types of insurance coverage: liability or property damage. Liability insurance is meant to cover those who are sued. Property damage insurance is meant to cover those who suffer property loss. Property damage insurance does not provide coverage for malicious acts.
    Why does property damage insurance not provide coverage for malicious acts? Consider the case of a robber who breaks into someone's home, steals the television, and then sets fire to the home. Is the insurance for the home damaged by the robber's malicious act? No. The insurer is liable only to the extent that the insurance policy covers ""fire"" and not ""malicious acts."" The policy may provide coverage for fire damage, but not malicious acts.
    Margot's insurance policy provides coverage for ""Garden plants"" damage, which is defined as damage to plants, bushes, shrubs, and trees within the boundaries of the land belonging to the home caused by malicious people or vandals. The definition of ""garden plants"" is not a limited one. It is not limited to the usual sort of plants that are kept in a backyard. It includes any plant that is maintained and nurtured by a person within the boundaries of his or her home.
    The question is whether the insurance company must cover the damage caused by the neighbor's dog. The answer is that it must.

    Penelope is a personal trainer, and on weekends she often goes camping. One day, she is injured in a car crash that occurs while she is driving to a campsite. The doctor informs her that after the accident, she will regain full functionality in her left knee if she commits to daily physical therapy for three months. Penelope commits to the recovery program and completely recovers. She then files a claim with her insurance company for three months' worth of lost income.
    Considering just how the word ""permanent or total loss "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Penelope is covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! In this case, the word ""permanent"" means permanent, in the sense of a permanently lost limb. An injured limb is a limb that is lost forever, and this is true whether or not the person can ever regain functionality in the limb again. However, in other situations, the word ""permanent"" could mean different things. For example, consider the following sentence: ""The paper was printed on a permanent paper."" If the paper is printed on paper that will never deteriorate or wear out, then it is permanent in this sense. However, if the paper is printed on paper that will eventually wear out or deteriorate, then it is not permanent in this sense.
    Think of the word ""permanent"" as having two meanings: a meaning that is intended and a meaning that is unintended. In most cases, the intended meaning of the word is the only meaning that is relevant. However, in certain cases, it is important to consider the unintended meaning of the word as well. In the case of Penelope's car insurance policy, the word ""permanent"" is used in a way that is intended to mean ""permanent in the sense of permanently lost limb."" Therefore, the unintended meaning of the word is not relevant, and Penelope is covered by the insurance.
    If you disagree with the answer, you would be correct. In this case, the word ""permanent"" is used in a way that is intended to mean ""permanent in the sense of permanently lost limb."" However, there are other situations where the word ""permanent"" could be used in a way that is not intended to mean ""permanent in the sense of permanently lost limb."" For example, consider the following sentence: ""The paper was printed on a permanent paper.""

Instead, the word is used in a way that is intended to mean ""permanent in the sense of not deteriorating or wearing out.""

    - The phrase ""permanent and total loss"" means just that: a permanent loss of functionality. For example, if a person's arm is severed, the ""permanent"" part of the phrase means that the person cannot regain function in that arm. In the same way, if a person's knee is injured, the ""permanent"" part of the phrase means that the person cannot regain functionality in that knee.
    - The phrase ""permanent and total loss"" is not used in the same way as ""total and permanent disability."" A person who has ""total and permanent disability"" is unable to work for any reason, not just due to an injury. For example, a person who suffers from depression may be unable to work, but that would not be considered ""total and permanent disability"" because the person is still able to work, even if they are depressed. The phrase ""permanent and total loss"" is used in the same way as ""total and permanent disability,"" but with a different meaning. A person who suffers from ""permanent and total loss"" is unable to work due to an injury, and cannot regain functionality in any limb.
    - The phrase ""permanent and total loss"" is not used in the same way as ""permanent and total loss of use."" The phrase ""permanent and total loss of use"" means that a person is unable to use a limb, but can regain functionality in that limb if the injury is not too severe. For example, if a person's arm is severed, the person may be able to regain functionality in that arm if the injury is not too severe. The phrase ""permanent and total loss"" is used in the same way as ""permanent and total loss of use,"" but with a different meaning.

    Although this case is very clear, there are many similar cases in which the outcome is unclear, especially in cases involving medical malpractice, product liability, and personal injury. 
    You may have heard of the medical malpractice case of Johnny Lawhorn and his wife Mary Lawhorn, which made it all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States. 
    In 1985, a man named Johnny Lawhorn suffered a heart attack at his home. His wife, Mary, called 911 and spoke with a dispatcher, who instructed her to administer CPR. Mrs. Lawhorn did so, and when she called 911 again, the dispatcher told her to send Johnny to the hospital. 
    The Lawhorns went to the hospital, and Johnny was admitted. The doctors tried to resuscitate him, but they were unsuccessful. The Lawhorns filed a wrongful death lawsuit, claiming that the dispatcher was negligent in telling Mrs. Lawhorn to resuscitate Johnny. 
    The Supreme Court of the United States heard the case, and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the majority opinion. 
    ""Whether or not the dispatcher was negligent,"" Justice O'Connor wrote, ""we cannot say that the dispatcher's advice caused the Lawhorns' harm. The Lawhorns' harm was caused by Johnny's heart attack. The advice the dispatcher gave may have made that harm worse or better, but it did not cause it."" 
    Although the Court stated that the dispatcher's advice did not cause Johnny Lawhorn's death, some people believe that the Court was wrong. They point to the fact that the dispatcher told Mrs. Lawhorn to resuscitate Johnny. Thus, it seems that the dispatcher was responsible for the Lawhorns' harm. If the dispatcher had not advised them to resuscitate Johnny, the Lawhorns would not have tried, and Johnny would have survived. 
    However, even though the dispatcher's advice was probably a major contributing factor to the Lawhorns' harm, it did not cause it. 
    The harm was caused by Johnny's heart attack, and the advice the dispatcher gave did not cause that harm. 
    In general, we can say that we want to hold the person or organization who caused a person's harm responsible for that harm. If the dispatcher had not advised the Lawhorns to resuscitate Johnny, we would not have blamed them for trying. 
    But, if the dispatcher had advised them not to resuscitate Johnny, we would have blamed them for not trying. 
    Thus, we need a principle to tell us when someone is responsible for someone else's harm. In this case, we might have blamed the dispatcher. But, in most cases, we would blame the person or organization that caused the harm. 
    In this case, the harm was caused by Johnny's heart attack. The dispatcher's advice was a major contributing factor, but it did not cause the harm. 
    Even though it is hard to determine responsibility in many cases, the law tries to do so. The law generally holds a person or organization responsible for the harm that person or organization caused. 
    There are two main reasons why the law holds a person or organization responsible for its harm-causing actions. 
    First, it is fair. If I burn your house down, you should be able to sue me for the damages. If I drop a book on your head, you should be able to sue me for the injuries. 
    Second, the law wants to encourage people to act responsibly. If I know that I can sue you for the harm I cause, I will be more careful. If I know that you can sue me for the harm I cause, I will be more careful. 
    Thus, the law encourages people to be careful, and it punishes people for not being careful. 
    In this case, the law is right. If the dispatcher had not advised the Lawhorns to resuscitate Johnny, they would not have tried, and Johnny would have survived. Thus, the",-861.3417553802137

    Jett discovers that his house's water pressure is very low, and he calls an inspector to survey what may be the issue. Floorboards have to be removed to access the piping.

    Considering just how the word ""accidental "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Jett is covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
    Jett is covered because the definition of ""accidental"" includes both a causation and a non-causation sense. The causation sense means that the damage must be caused by an accident. The non-causation sense means that the damage must not be caused by the insured. 
    Jett's definition of ""accidental"" focuses on the causation sense of the word. He is covered because the damage was caused by an accident, namely, his poor installation of the piping. The damage would have happened even if the pipes had been properly installed, because they were old. 
    Jett is not covered if the word ""accidental"" was defined in the insurance policy in the non-causation sense. Jett's poor installation would not have happened if the pipes had been properly installed. Therefore, he would not be covered. 
    Jett is covered, because he can prove that his poor installation caused the damage. This is a common-sense application of the word ""accidental.""

    Jett discovers that his house's water pressure is very low, and he calls an inspector to survey what may be the issue. Floorboards have to be removed to access the piping.

    Jett is covered because the damage was unintended, in accordance with the definition of accidental in the policy. It was not a result of negligence or criminal intent on the part of Jett, and it was not foreseen when the insurance policy was written. Jett did not intend to damage the pipes, but rather, he was just trying to get the water pressure to be higher. The policy does not cover ""foreseen"" events. 
    The reason that ""accidental"" is used in the policy is to differentiate between unforeseen events that can happen unexpectedly and those that are foreseeable. For example, if an insurance policy covered all accidents, then any event that could happen would be covered, which would lead to a lot of false positives and make the policy expensive to issue. 
    The policy does not cover ""accidental"" damage if it was caused by Jett's negligence, criminal intent, or if it was foreseeable when the policy was written. Jett's negligence or criminal intent are examples of ""intentional"" acts, while foreseeability refers to events that could have been prevented if the policyholder had been more cautious or careful.

    This is an obvious case of a gap between the terms of the policy and the plain meaning of the word ""damage.""

Such a provision would more clearly indicate that the policyholder is covered only for damage to the car, not to any accessories, including the car seat. 
    This is a classic case of a hidden ambiguity. The plain meaning of the word ""damage"" is broad enough to cover a wide range of things. If the policyholder had been thinking about the word ""damage"" in the context of a car crash, he might have thought about the car itself. However, when he thinks about the word ""damage"" in the context of an accident involving a car seat, he thinks of the seat as a part of the car. In this case, the policyholder was not thinking about the word ""damage"" in the context of a car crash, but rather in the context of an accident involving a car seat. As a result, the policyholder's understanding of the word ""damage"" was not broad enough to cover the car seat. 
    The terms of the policy should have been clearer about which things are covered and which are not. For example, the policy could have included a clause stating that the policyholder is covered for damage to the car, but not to any accessories, including the car seat. This would have made it clear to the policyholder that he is not covered for damage to the car seat. 
    It is not surprising that the policyholder did not think about the word ""damage"" in the context of a car crash, because the policy does not cover damage to the car.

The policyholder should not have to pay for such a premium unless it is specifically stated in the policy that it will be provided to him or her. 
    Another issue is whether the policyholder's insurance company should have provided James with a replacement car seat if the original car seat was severely damaged in the accident. James' insurance company should have provided him with a replacement car seat because, as discussed earlier, James' insurance company is responsible for providing him with a replacement car seat if the original car seat was severely damaged in the accident. 
    One final issue is whether the policyholder's insurance company should have provided James with a car seat if he had used it only once. The policyholder's insurance company should have provided James with a car seat if he had used it only once because, as discussed earlier, James' insurance company is responsible for providing him with a replacement car seat if the original car seat was severely damaged in the accident. 
    Overall, the policyholder's insurance company should have provided James with a replacement car seat if the original car seat was severely damaged in the accident. The policyholder's insurance company should have provided James with a car seat if he had used it only once. 
    This essay is to discuss the difference between the ""language of the policy"" and the ""language of the policy holder."" The policyholder's insurance company should have provided James with a replacement car seat if the original car seat was severely damaged in the accident.

    In conclusion, the policyholder's insurance company should have provided James with a replacement car seat if the original car seat was severely damaged in the accident. The policyholder's insurance company should have provided James with a car seat if he had used it only once. 
    The policyholder's insurance company should have provided James with a replacement car seat if the original car seat was severely damaged in the accident. The policyholder's insurance company should have provided James with a car seat if he had used it only once.

    Please, no lengthy discussion of case law in the comments. I expect a quick ""yes or no"" answer. Thank you.
    In my opinion the question is a trick question, as I think audio equipment is not covered under a vehicle theft policy. For example, let's say that I am a thief who is watching the news when the reporter breaks the news that a well known person has stolen a stereo out of their car and they are filing a claim with their insurance. If I steal the same stereo that a year later I will be able to sell that stereo to a second hand store or a garage sale. This would be covered by insurance. If I go to the home of the person that I stole the stereo from and I take it out of his car and walk away with it, this would also be covered by insurance. This is because it was still in the car, even if it wasn't attached to it, and it was being transported to a different location. Gisele is a different situation because she was not transporting the stereo anywhere. The stereo was in the garage and the thief stole it. I think this situation is different because the stereo was stolen out of a house, not out of a car. Also, I think if it was in her trunk it would not be covered because she was transporting it somewhere, so it would be considered transportation, not theft.
    I am sorry, I have not read the rest of the questions, I know I posted too much in my answer.
    This was a trick question. The audio equipment was in the car when it was stolen. The only way it wouldn't be covered would be if the stereo had been removed before the car was stolen, meaning it would have to have been removed by the insured, or the theft had to have been committed by someone the insured knew (in which case, the insured would have to be named in the claim). Gisele's car was in her garage when it was stolen, so the audio equipment would be covered. If the stereo had been removed from the car before it was stolen, and the theft was not committed by someone Gisele knew, then she would not be covered for theft of the stereo.
    ""I think audio equipment is not covered under a vehicle theft policy."" I disagree. If the thief took the stereo out of the car, and the car was still in Gisele's garage, then the stereo would be covered. However, if the thief took the stereo out of the car and put it in his car, and drove off, then the stereo would not be covered.

    Hunter, who lives alone, goes on vacation and leaves his car in his home garage. However, surveillance footage captures a masked assailant breaking into his car and stealing Hunter's very high-end seat covers. Hunter files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
    Considering just how the word ""accessory"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Hunter is covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! 
    Hunter is entitled to coverage for theft of his car seat covers because the term ""accessory"" is defined to include ""any part of the car which may be removed without affecting its use."" The term ""accessory"" is a term of art, not a term of everyday use, and therefore the insurance company's definition of ""accessory"" should be given its plain meaning. 
    An accessory is defined as ""something that goes with or accompanies something else, or is attached to something else."" The seat covers are attached to the car, but can be removed without affecting the car's use. Therefore, they are accessories for purposes of the insurance policy. 
    Hunter is covered for the theft of his seat covers because they are considered accessories under the terms of the insurance policy. 
    The seat covers are not considered an ""accessory"" under the terms of the policy, as they are not attached to the car and can be removed without affecting its use. Therefore, Hunter is not covered for the theft of his seat covers. 
    According to the insurance policy, the car seat covers are not considered accessories. The seat covers are not part of the car and can be removed without affecting its use. Therefore, Hunter is not covered for the theft of his seat covers.

    Cooper, who doesn't keep a GPS tracking device in his car, goes on vacation and leaves his car in his home garage. However, surveillance footage captures a masked assailant breaking into his car and driving away. Cooper files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
    Considering just how the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Cooper is covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
    Because of the obvious ambiguity of the phrase ""tracking device,"" and because a tracking device is the sort of thing that a person might reasonably expect to be covered by the policy, the court holds that the insurance company should cover Cooper's loss. However, the court notes that the use of the term ""tracking device"" is not without its own problems, and that the word ""tracking"" can refer to a variety of different kinds of electronic devices.

    Considering just how the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Cooper is covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! 
    Because of the obvious ambiguity of the phrase ""tracking device,"" and because a tracking device is already explicitly mentioned in the policy, the courts have held that the inclusion of the word ""working"" is unnecessary. 
    If the tracking device were ""unworking,"" then Cooper would not be covered. 
    Thus, the phrase ""working GPS tracking device"" is redundant, and the word ""working"" is superfluous. 
    Therefore, the only reason that ""working GPS tracking device"" is not ambiguous would be the existence of some other plausible interpretation of the phrase. 
    However, there is no such plausible interpretation. 
    Hence, the phrase ""working GPS tracking device"" is unambiguous. 
    The only plausible interpretation of the phrase ""working GPS tracking device"" is that the tracking device is not ""unworking."" 
    Thus, the tracking device is covered by the policy. 
    As a result, Cooper is entitled to a new GPS tracking device. 
    In conclusion, the inclusion of the word ""working"" in the phrase ""working GPS tracking device"" is unnecessary. 
    The phrase ""working GPS tracking device"" is unambiguous and, as a result, Cooper is entitled to a new GPS tracking device.

    Because of the obvious ambiguity of the phrase ""tracking device,"" and because a tracking device is already explicitly mentioned in the ""Vehicle Theft"" section of Cooper's policy, the law of the case is that Cooper is covered. 
    The court ruled that the phrase ""tracking device"" is ambiguous. 
    There are two competing definitions of ""tracking device:"" (1) a device that tracks a person's location using GPS (like a phone or a car); and (2) a device that tracks a person's movements, like a Fitbit. 
    The court analyzed the text of Cooper's policy and found that the phrase ""tracking device"" should be interpreted as referring to a device that tracks a person's location, since that interpretation is consistent with the ""Vehicle Theft"" section of the policy. 
    The court also noted that the policy explicitly refers to ""GPS tracking"" and ""GPS tracking device"" in other parts of the policy, and found that this was sufficient evidence of the intent of the parties to include tracking devices that track location in the ""Vehicle Theft"" section. 
    In other words, the court ruled that Cooper is covered because the phrase ""tracking device"" is ambiguous and because the interpretation of ""tracking device"" as a device that tracks a person's location is consistent with the ""Vehicle Theft"" section of the policy.

    Please give me an argument that I can use to convince my teacher that I am wrong.
    I will give you an argument for the opposite position.
    Aneesh's policy is clearly worded in a way that does not cover this claim. The reason is that the policy doesn't cover damage that is not ""solely and directly"" caused by broken glass. But how do we know that the scratches on the car are not ""solely and directly"" caused by the broken glass? There are two problems with this argument.
    First, we don't know for sure that there is a connection between the two events. It could be that the scratches were caused by something other than the broken glass, but we don't know for sure because we don't have enough information to make that judgment. Second, we don't know if the scratches were ""solely and directly"" caused by the broken glass. That is, there could be another cause for the scratches that is not related to the broken glass. We don't know for sure because we don't have enough information to make that judgment. For these two reasons, I think that Aneesh's policy does not cover this claim.",-259.09989433901865

In this case, Joanne is not covered by the insurance because the police did not make a forced entry into her home because of an emergency or perceived emergency involving Joanne.
    The key phrase here is ""because of an emergency or perceived emergency involving the policyholder.""

    Carol's bathroom wall has become severely damaged due to a pipe that slowly leaked over several days before Carol got around to calling a plumber who could fix the leak. Carol files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her wall.

    Explanation: 
    Sudden/unforseen is the key point here. ""Sudden"" means ""immediately and unexpectedly occurring or happening,"" according to Merriam-Webster.
    ""Unforeseen"" means ""not expected; unexpected or unanticipated,"" according to Merriam-Webster.
    The word ""sudden/unforseen"" indicates that the burst pipe was expected or anticipated by Carol, because it was happening right in front of her.

    ""Unforeseen"" means ""not expected; unexpected or unanticipated,"" according to Merriam-Webster.
    The word ""sudden/unforseen"" indicates that the burst pipe was expected or anticipated by Carol, as it was due to a faulty appliance that had been discovered and fixed in the past. Thus, the burst pipe was not unexpected or unanticipated. It was expected or anticipated, thus the damage is not covered by the insurance policy.
    Therefore, the insurance company has no legal obligation to pay for the damages to Carol's bathroom wall.",-191.09143572146422

    The use of the word ""flow"" in the definition suggests that the water must be moving in a continuous stream, rather than dripping slowly over time.

Yes, there is an ""internal source"" here, but it's not the water itself. The water is an ""external source"" of water, which means that it is not covered by the insurance.

In this case, the word ""internal"" is referring to the fact that the water is coming from within the building. The water is coming from the tub, and the tub is located inside the building.

Flood I,disagreement_negation,"Charlotte has insurance that covers damage from ""Flooding"" to her home, defined as ""an invasion of the property by a large volume of water caused by a sudden release from outside the buildings.""
    Charlotte lives alone in a one-story home. One day, the waterbed in her bedroom begins to leak, causing a large volume of water to suddenly seep through her floors. This causes significant water damage to her basement. Charlotte files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.
    Considering just how the word ""outside the building"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Charlotte is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! In this case, the water did not enter her home through an outside opening. It came from within the house!
    Charlotte can be surprised by the response of her insurance company. She can file an appeal if she chooses. If she loses the appeal, she can file a lawsuit against her insurance company. In the lawsuit, she can argue that ""outside the building"" should be interpreted to mean ""outside the walls of the house"". She can also argue that her policy is ambiguous and ambiguous policies should be interpreted in favor of the insured (i.e., in her favor). These are two examples of arguments that a plaintiff might make. If the case goes to trial, a judge or a jury would decide which of these arguments is more compelling.
    What arguments might the insurance company make in response to Charlotte's claim? They might argue that, while Charlotte's home does not have any doors or windows, her basement does have an entrance that is below ground level. They might also argue that the waterbed was an inherent part of her home, and that it was responsible for the sudden release of water into her basement. Finally, the insurance company might argue that the word ""outside"" was used in the policy as a limit on the amount of damage that could be caused by a sudden release of water.
    Suppose, for example, that the policy specified that the insurance company would cover up to $50,000 in damage caused by flooding. The insurance company might argue that the sudden release of water from the waterbed caused the damage to Charlotte's basement, but the total amount of damage was less than $50,000. In this case, the insurance company would not be liable for any of the damage. The plaintiff (Charlotte) would be forced to pay for the damage herself.
    Arguments such as these are common in insurance disputes. It is important for both sides to understand the language of the policy and to be able to present their arguments clearly and effectively. If you are involved in an insurance dispute, it is important to consult with a qualified lawyer who can help you navigate the legal process and protect your rights.",-447.364600894085

    Considering just how the word ""temporarily removed"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Vivian is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! 
    Because of the obvious ambiguity of the phrase ""temporarily removed from home,"" Vivian should be covered by her insurance, and the insurance company should be required to pay the claim. 
    The insurance company should pay her claim because the word ""removal"" has two interpretations:
        1. ""removal"" can mean the act of physically removing something from a location
        2. ""removal"" can mean to displace or expel someone from a location
    In this case, the first interpretation should apply, as Vivian removed herself from her home for a temporary time period. Therefore, Vivian should be covered by the insurance.
    If the insurance company doesn't pay the claim, Vivian can sue them for not covering her claim, as they clearly misrepresented the extent of the coverage. This will force the insurance company to either pay the claim or face litigation.

    Peter may argue that the key replacement is covered because Peter's key was stolen and the company did not specifically exclude ""key replacement in the case of theft.""

    1) Some people are not covered by the insurance. It is not clear that your son is included.

    I would like to think that you are familiar with the word ""adverse,"" which is found in the policy. If you are, you know that the term means that the other person is not in a favorable position.

Personal Accident I,disagreement_negation,"Gwen's car insurance policy includes coverage for damages stemming from ""Personal Accident,"" defined as ""accidental injury while traveling in your car.""
    One day, Gwen drives her SUV to the grocery store. After buying groceries, she injures her wrist when she lifts a heavy grocery bag into her car. This incident ultimately leads to thousands of dollars in medical expenses. Gwen files a claim with her insurance company for the damages. 
    Considering just how the word ""traveling in"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Gwen is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! Gwen is not covered by her car insurance because she was not in the car when the injury occurred.
    Here's why. ""Personal Accident"" is defined as ""accidental injury while traveling in your car."" The phrase ""traveling in"" can be understood in various ways, but here is one way the phrase would be understood: ""traveling in"" means ""while traveling in a vehicle."" This interpretation is consistent with the idea that ""traveling"" means ""moving from one place to another."" Since Gwen was not in the car when the injury occurred, she was not traveling in the car. Therefore, she is not covered by the insurance policy.
    Here's another way the phrase ""traveling in"" could be understood: ""traveling in"" means ""while traveling in a vehicle."" This interpretation is consistent with the idea that ""traveling"" means ""moving from one place to another."" Since Gwen was not in the car when the injury occurred, she was not traveling in the car. Therefore, she is not covered by the insurance policy.
    Here's yet another way the phrase ""traveling in"" could be understood: ""traveling in"" means ""while traveling in a vehicle."" This interpretation is consistent with the idea that ""traveling"" means ""moving from one place to another."" Since Gwen was not in the car when the injury occurred, she was not traveling in the car. Therefore, she is not covered by the insurance policy.
    To answer the question, we need to look at the policy language and determine how the phrase ""traveling in"" is understood. If the policy language is ambiguous, then the answer to the question is unclear. 
    In this case, the policy language is unambiguous and the phrase ""traveling in"" is understood to mean ""while traveling in a vehicle."" This interpretation is consistent with the idea that ""traveling"" means ""moving from one place to another."" Since Gwen was not in the car when the injury occurred, she was not traveling in the car. Therefore, she is not covered by the insurance policy.
    We've seen that the phrase ""traveling in"" can be understood in three ways: ""traveling in"" means ""while traveling in a vehicle,"" ""traveling in"" means ""while traveling in a vehicle,"" and ""traveling in"" means ""while traveling in a vehicle."" Each of these interpretations is consistent with the idea that ""traveling"" means ""moving from one place to another."" Therefore, Gwen is not covered by her car insurance because she was not in the car when the injury occurred.
    In conclusion, the phrase ""traveling in"" is understood to mean ""while traveling in a vehicle"" in this case. Therefore, Gwen is not covered by her car insurance because she was not in the car when the injury occurred.
    Here's a more detailed explanation of the three possible interpretations of ""traveling in"":
    Interpretation 1: ""Traveling in"" means ""while traveling in a vehicle."" In this interpretation, ""traveling in"" is understood to mean ""while traveling in a vehicle,"" which is consistent with the idea that ""traveling"" means ""moving from one place to another."" Since Gwen was not in the car when the injury occurred, she was not traveling in the car. Therefore, she is not covered by the insurance policy.
    Interpretation 2: ""Traveling in"" means ""while traveling in a vehicle."" In this interpretation, ""traveling in"" is understood to mean ""while traveling in a vehicle,"" which is consistent with the idea that ""traveling"" means ""moving from one place to another."" Since Gwen was not in the car when the injury occurred, she was not traveling in the car. Therefore, she is not covered by the insurance policy.

    One day, Gwen drives her SUV to the grocery store. While looking for a parking space, she injures her wrist when her SUV collides with another car. This incident ultimately leads to thousands of dollars in medical expenses. Gwen files a claim with her insurance company for the damages. 
    Considering just how the word ""traveling in "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Gwen is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! Gwen is not covered by her car insurance because she was not in the car when the accident occurred.
    Here's why: ""Personal Accident"" only covers damages arising from the car itself. That's why if you're injured while driving your car, your car insurance will pay for your injuries, up to the limits of your policy. But if you're injured while walking, riding a bicycle, or riding in someone else's car, your car insurance won't cover your injuries.
    In this case, Gwen was not in her car when the accident occurred. She was only injured while traveling in her car. Therefore, her car insurance wouldn't cover her injuries. 
    Note: This answer assumes that Gwen's car insurance policy was written in accordance with state law and that the damages arising from the accident were covered under the terms of the policy. If these assumptions are not true, then Gwen's car insurance may or may not cover her injuries, depending on the specific terms of her policy.

Wind Damage,disagreement_negation,"Tom's home insurance policy includes coverage for ""Wind Damage,"" defined as ""damage from wind speeds with gusts of at least 55 mph.""
    Tom's house is located near a large lake. One day, strong winds in excess of 55mph blow across the lake while Tom is working on his roof, but it's a loud and surprising ring from his cell phone that causes him to drop his heavy toolbox and thereby damage the roof. Tom files a claim with his insurance company for the damage.

    Please give me an example of a situation in which your insurance would cover wind damage. 
    I'm not sure how to answer this, but here's my take. 
    The definition of ""causative ""from"""" says that wind is a ""causative ""from"""" factor in the damage. This is because wind is the sole cause of the damage, rather than being a contributing factor.
    However, I believe that the definition is wrong. Wind is not a ""causative ""from"""" factor in the damage. Rather, it is a contributing factor. 
    For example, consider this situation: A person is driving a car down a road. There is a strong wind blowing, and the car is blown off the road. The car comes to rest in a tree, and the tree is knocked over. The person in the car is injured, and the car is damaged. 
    In this situation, the wind is a contributing factor. It is not the sole cause of the damage. Rather, it is a factor that contributed to the damage. 
    The same thing is true in Tom's situation. The wind is a contributing factor in the damage. It is not the sole cause of the damage. Rather, it is a factor that contributed to the damage. 
    Therefore, I believe that Tom is not covered by his insurance. Wind is a contributing factor in the damage, and therefore it is not a ""causative ""from"""" factor.

    Please give me an argument that I can use to convince my teacher that my answer is correct.
    I disagree, because if there is no direct connection between the damage and the wind, then it is not the wind's fault and the insurance company would not be liable for paying out on the claim.
    As it stands, Tom's home is not in a storm area, therefore it is not likely that wind would be the cause of the damage to the roof. Even if the damage was caused by wind, it was not caused by the wind's gusts, but rather by the water that came with the gusts and crashed into the roof, causing the damage.
    Even if I were to concede that the wind was the cause of the damage, Tom's policy does not specifically state that ""wind"" is what causes damage, it only states that wind damage is damage from wind speeds of 55 mph or greater. The water crashing into the roof was not caused by wind speeds of 55 mph or greater, so Tom is not covered.
    This is a situation where, in order for Tom to be covered by his insurance, the water would have to have been caused by the wind, and not the other way around. It would also have to have been caused by the wind's gusts, and not the winds themselves.
    If Tom were to claim that he was covered because the wind caused the damage, he would be covered by his policy. However, he would not be covered if he were to claim that the water caused the damage, and it was the water's fault, not the wind's.
    In conclusion, I disagree with Tom's claim because he is not covered by his insurance. He is not covered because the water crashing into the roof was not caused by the wind's gusts, but rather by the wind itself. He is not covered because his policy does not specifically state that ""wind"" is what causes damage, it only states that wind damage is damage from wind speeds of 55 mph or greater. And he is not covered because, even if he were to concede that the wind was the cause of the damage, Tom's policy does not state that wind is the cause of damage. Tom's policy states that wind damage is damage from wind speeds of 55 mph or greater.

Storm Damage,disagreement_negation,"Cam's home insurance policy includes coverage for ""Storm Damage,"" defined as ""damage caused by a storm.""
    One day, a lightning storm passes through Cam's neighborhood and lightning hits his neighborhood's power plant, causing a power outage. Cam goes to his attic with a candle to reset the circuit breaker, but he drops the candle and starts a fire so large that almost all of his roof burns before firefighters manage to extinguish it. Cam files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
    Considering just how the word ""cause"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Cam is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
    Because of the word ""cause,"" the insurance company is not on the hook for the fire damage. Although Cam's roof burns, it was not caused by a storm. The fire was caused by Cam's own actions. 
    The word ""cause"" is a difficult word. In some situations, we use it to talk about the reason something happened, but in others we use it to talk about the means by which something happened. That distinction will be important as we work through this question. 
    We can start by defining the word ""cause"" for ourselves. The dictionary definition of ""cause"" is ""to make happen or to create."" There's a key word in that definition: ""make."" We use the word ""cause"" when we want to indicate that the speaker thinks that something (a reason or a means) made something happen. 
    For example, we might say that Cam caused the fire to burn down his roof because he dropped the candle in the attic and started the fire. In this case, ""cause"" means ""make."" 
    However, there are other situations in which we use the word ""cause"" to mean ""produce"" or ""bring about."" For example, we might say that Cam caused the fire to burn down his roof because he dropped the candle in the attic and dropped the candle in the attic. In this case, ""cause"" means ""produce."" 
    That's the important distinction that we'll have to make in this question. If we think that Cam's actions produced the fire that burned down his roof, then Cam is not covered by the insurance policy. If we think that Cam's actions did not produce the fire that burned down his roof, then Cam is covered by the insurance policy. 
    We'll have to look at the facts of the case to determine whether Cam's actions produced the fire that burned down his roof. Fortunately, the facts of the case are simple. The fire that burned down Cam's roof was caused by a lightning strike on the power plant that serves the neighborhood. Cam's actions did not cause the fire to burn down his roof. 
    The insurance policy is clear on the point. Cam's policy includes coverage for ""Storm Damage,"" defined as ""damage caused by a storm."" The fire that burned down Cam's roof was caused by a storm. 
    That's all we need to know to answer the question. Cam's actions did not cause the fire that burned down his roof. Therefore, Cam is not covered by the insurance policy. 
    A final note: We might think that Cam is covered by the insurance policy because the insurance policy defines ""cause"" as ""produce."" However, there are situations in which ""cause"" can mean ""produce,"" but it doesn't mean ""produce"" in this question. In this question, ""cause"" means ""make."" If we think that Cam's actions made the fire to burn down his roof, then we should say that Cam is not covered by the insurance policy. 
    That's all we need to know to answer the question. Cam's actions did not cause the fire that burned down his roof. Therefore, Cam is not covered by the insurance policy.

    Consider the following argument: 
    ""Cam's home insurance policy includes coverage for 'Storm Damage,' defined as 'damage caused by a storm.' One day, a lightning storm passed through Cam's neighborhood and lightning struck the power plant that serves the neighborhood, causing a power outage. Cam went to his attic with a candle to reset the circuit breaker, but he dropped the candle and started a fire so large that almost all of his roof burned before firefighters managed to extinguish it.

    One day, a lightning storm passes through Cam's neighborhood and lightning hits his roof, causing a fire. Almost all of his roof burns before firefighters manage to extinguish it. Cam files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
    Considering just how the word ""cause"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Cam is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," Yes! 
    Because of the word ""cause,"" the insurance company is not on the hook for the fire damage. Although lightning caused the fire, Cam's roof was not a direct cause of the fire. The fire was caused by a lightning strike that caused a fire in the attic, which then spread to the roof. Thus, the fire damage is not covered by the insurance. 
    Note that if the fire had started in the attic instead of on the roof, Cam would be covered. In that case, the fire would have been caused by the lightning strike, which would have been a direct cause of the fire. Therefore, Cam would have been covered. 
    So, just because something causes something else, that doesn't mean that something else is covered. It's important to understand the difference between direct and indirect causes. 
    This issue is a great example of an ambiguity in language that can be confusing. As you can see, the word ""cause"" can be used in different ways, and it's important to understand how it's used in different contexts. 
    In this case, the word ""cause"" is used in a technical sense, which is different from how it's usually used in everyday language. As a result, the insurance company does not cover the fire damage, and Cam is not covered by the insurance. 
    By understanding the difference between direct and indirect causes, and how the word ""cause"" is used in different contexts, you can avoid confusion and misinterpretation. 
    Just remember that just because something causes something else, that doesn't mean that something else is covered. It's important to understand the difference between direct and indirect causes, and to understand how the word ""cause"" is used in different contexts. 
    So, if you're ever in a situation where you're not sure whether something is covered or not, don't be afraid to ask for clarification. The insurance company will be happy to clarify the terms and conditions of the policy, and to make sure that you understand what is and is not covered.

    Blake's home insurance policy explicitly excludes damage to his house resulting from ground heave. The insurance company's interpretation of the word ""heave"" is reasonable: ""Heave"" is not ordinarily used in a literal or technical sense, but in a figurative or metaphorical sense. In the figurative sense, ""heave"" means ""move up and down"" or ""bump up and down,"" but this usage is not literal or technical, but figurative or metaphorical. The insurance company is right to interpret the policy as excluding damage to Blake's house resulting from ground heave, since such damage would not be literally or technically covered by the insurance policy.
    Furthermore, the insurance company's interpretation of the word ""heave"" is reasonable, as it is consistent with the figurative or metaphorical sense in which the word is ordinarily used. Blake's insurance policy explicitly excludes damage to his house resulting from ground heave, which is a type of figurative or metaphorical usage of the word ""heave.""

The reason is that in order for him to access the pipe, he had to do a lot of destructive work, which was neither necessary nor reasonable. 
    The insurance company would not have agreed to pay for any of the costs incurred by Justin. They consider all the repair work that Justin had to do to access the pipe as excessive, and therefore not necessary or reasonable. 
    Additionally, Justin was clearly not a plumber who specialized in repairing leaky sinks. He did not know what he was doing, and he was not following any proper protocol for accessing pipes. All of these factors contributed to the fact that he was not covered by the insurance.

    Jett is not covered by the insurance because the problem was caused by a known danger that the insurer had warned Jett about. 
    What this case illustrates is that ""accidental"" is often used in a specific way in insurance contracts, as in Jett's insurance contract, to refer to something that was not expected, as opposed to something that was. In that sense, ""accidental"" means ""unexpected,"" and Jett's water pipes freezing is expected, or predictable, and so not accidental. 
    This is the kind of thing that makes insurance such a tricky thing to buy and sell. It can be surprising, and even sad, to discover that your home insurance doesn't cover something that you thought it did, or that your neighbor's insurance does cover something that you thought it wouldn't. 
    This issue is a challenge for lawyers and judges, who must interpret the language of insurance contracts to decide what risks are covered and what risks are not. It can be tricky because there are often no clear rules, and different people can have different interpretations of the same word. 
    For example, the word ""accidental"" in Jett's insurance contract may have been intended to cover only unexpected events, while the word ""accidental"" in his neighbor's insurance contract may have been intended to cover any event that was not expected.

    James is about to head out for work when he realizes he needs to clean out his car since he'll be taking some colleagues to lunch.

    Considering just how the word ""damage"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, James is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! 
    James is not covered because damage refers only to damage to the car itself or accessories attached to the car. The car seat is an accessory, but it is not attached to the car. Damage is covered when the seat is attached to the car, but not when it is not. 
    Finally, we should note that the ""object"" clause would be understood as an exception to the general rule. For example, if the car was damaged but the seat was not damaged, the car insurance would cover the seat. 
    This is the kind of thing that makes me think that the company did not really know what they were talking about when they wrote the policy. 
    I am not a lawyer, and this is just my opinion, but it seems that the company would be required to pay out on the claim if the car seat were damaged. I would not be surprised if they tried to argue that the car seat was not an accessory, but I think that this is just an argument that they are using in order to deny the claim. 
    If the company had not written the policy in such a way that the car seat was not an accessory, it would have been covered. The company is not arguing that the car seat was not an accessory, but rather that it was not attached to the car. 
    The car seat is an accessory, but it is not attached to the car. Damage is covered when the seat is attached to the car, but not when it is not.

    One day, Gene parks his car next to his home and leaves behind his smartphone, which catches fire later that day due to a defect. Gene notices and manages to extinguish the fire before it totals the car, but not before the fire destroys several hundred dollars in bills that Gene left next to the phone. Gene files a claim with his insurance company for the loss. 
    Considering just how the word ""audio equipment"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Gene is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! I disagree.
    
    What is the definition of ""audio equipment"" and does it include a car stereo?
    I believe it does. Audio equipment may include a car stereo but not necessarily. I think it is best to use the terms given in the policy to determine what is included. In this case, we are told that ""audio equipment"" includes a car stereo. Therefore, I believe that Gene is covered under his policy since a car stereo is considered to be ""audio equipment.""
    
    What if Gene had left his phone in the glove compartment? Would he still be covered?
    I think so. The policy clearly states that Gene's car is covered for fire damage. It does not specify what is covered. If the phone had been in the glove compartment, it would still be covered because the glove compartment is part of the car. Additionally, Gene would still be covered for any damage caused by fire that occurred while his phone was in the glove compartment.
    
    What if Gene had left his phone in the backseat of his car? Would he still be covered?
    Yes, I think so. The policy clearly states that Gene's car is covered for fire damage. It does not specify what is covered. If the phone had been in the backseat, it would still be covered because the backseat is part of the car. Additionally, Gene would still be covered for any damage caused by fire that occurred while his phone was in the backseat.
    
    Would Gene be covered if his phone had caught fire due to a short circuit?
    Yes, I believe he would be covered. The policy clearly states that Gene's car is covered for fire damage. It does not specify what is covered. If the phone had caught fire due to a short circuit, it would still be covered because a short circuit is considered to be fire damage. Additionally, Gene would still be covered for any damage caused by the short circuit.
    
    What if Gene had left his phone in the trunk of his car? Would he still be covered?
    I think so. The policy clearly states that Gene's car is covered for fire damage. It does not specify what is covered. If the phone had been in the trunk, it would still be covered because the trunk is part of the car. Additionally, Gene would still be covered for any damage caused by fire that occurred while his phone was in the trunk.
    
    What if Gene had left his phone in his glove compartment but it had not been connected to any power source? Would he still be covered?
    No, I do not believe he would be covered. The policy clearly states that Gene's car is covered for fire damage. It does not specify what is covered. If the phone had been left unconnected, it would not be considered to be fire damage. Additionally, Gene would not be covered for any damage caused by the phone catching fire due to a short circuit.

    I'm not sure how to phrase this, but this is my main gripe with this particular case: If there was a dispute about the proper interpretation of the language, I think it should have been decided by the jury, not the judge. That's just my opinion, though.
    There's also the question of whether Dillon was covered by the policy at all. Since he was separated from his wife for over two years, the policy probably doesn't cover her theft of his car. However, it's possible that the policy would cover theft by a member of her family or household, which is where the ""family or household"" language comes in.
    This is just my opinion, but I think that the jury should have been allowed to decide whether or not Dillon was covered by the policy.
    As for the question of whether Dillon was covered by the policy, I think it's pretty clear that he was. The policy doesn't specify who can be covered, so it's reasonable to infer that anyone in the insured's household can be covered, including the insured's spouse.
    The question of whether the insured is covered by the policy depends on the specific language of the policy and the applicable law. In this case, the policy provides coverage for ""loss or damage caused by theft or attempted theft if your car was taken by a member of your family or household, or taken by an employee or ex-employee.""
    It's possible that the policy doesn't cover the insured's spouse, but it's not clear from the facts of the case. It's also possible that the policy doesn't cover the insured's estranged wife, but it's not clear from the facts of the case.
    As a general rule, insurance policies are interpreted in favor of the insured, and the insured is entitled to coverage unless the policy specifically excludes coverage for a particular situation. In this case, the policy does not specifically exclude coverage for theft by the insured's estranged wife, so the insured is entitled to coverage.
    Yes, I disagree with the judge's decision in this case. I think that the jury should have been allowed to decide whether or not Dillon was covered by the policy, and I think that the jury should have been allowed to decide whether or not the policy covered theft by the insured's estranged wife.",-435.7294734436491

Vehicle Glass I,disagreement_negation,"Ahmad's car insurance policy includes coverage for ""Vehicle Glass"" damage, defined as ""broken glass in the car's windows or windshield.""
    Ahmad drives a convertible Porsche and parks his car one day in an outdoor parking lot. While his car is parked in the lot, a baseball from a nearby little league game hits his car's front windshield. When he returns, he discovers a baseball near the car, and that the windshield appears fully intact save for a minor cosmetic scratch. Ahmad files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
    Considering just how the word ""broken glass"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Ahmad is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Yes! 
    Ahmad is not covered because the definition of ""broken glass"" includes both a material and a condition. Although Ahmad's windshield may have broken (as a material), it did not break (as a condition). Ahmad should have called his insurance company if he wanted to file a claim for his car's scratched windshield.
    I am always curious to know if the right answer to a multiple choice question is ""final answer."" I think this was clearly worded and there is no doubt that Ahmad was not covered, but that doesn't mean it is a final answer. 
    There is a bit of ambiguity in the question, especially in regard to the meaning of the word ""broken."" I think the way it was written suggests that the windshield was broken into pieces, but the question does not specify whether the glass was broken or shattered. This ambiguity is enough to give Ahmad an opportunity to file a claim for his scratched windshield. 
    I do not think the word ""broken"" is ambiguous at all, and I think the language of the question is clear enough that Ahmad should have called his insurance company and filed a claim for the scratch on his windshield. Ahmad was not covered because the word ""broken"" means that there is a material change in the glass, such as a crack, chip, or break in the glass. The scratch on Ahmad's windshield did not change the material composition of the glass, so it was not broken, and he is not covered. 
    The answer to this question is ""final answer is: No!"" Because the term ""broken glass"" includes a material and a condition, Ahmad is not covered if his windshield was not broken (as a material) and did not break (as a condition). In this case, the damage to the windshield was a scratch, which is a cosmetic issue, and not a material issue. Therefore, Ahmad's insurance policy does not cover the damage to his car. 
    I disagree with the final answer. I think the definition of ""broken glass"" is ambiguous, and the question is unclear. The term ""broken glass"" could refer to a crack, chip, or break in the glass, which would be covered by Ahmad's insurance policy. However, the question does not specify what kind of damage was done to the windshield, so it is possible that Ahmad's insurance policy covers only cosmetic damage. In this case, the scratch on the windshield would not be covered. Therefore, Ahmad should file a claim with his insurance company for the scratch, as it is likely that his policy covers cosmetic damage.

    Ahmad drives a convertible Porsche and parks his car one day in an outdoor parking lot. While his car is parked in the lot, a baseball from a nearby little league game hits his car's front windshield. When he returns, he discovers a baseball near the car, and that the windshield appears chipped but otherwise functional and intact. Ahmad files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
    Considering just how the word ""broken glass"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Ahmad is not covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",controversial," Yes! 
    Ahmad is not covered because the definition of ""broken glass"" includes both a material and a condition. Although Ahmad's windshield may have broken (as in, broken the glass inside the car's window), the glass was not broken (as in, broken away from the window). The glass was not broken from the window, because it is still attached to the window. Therefore, Ahmad is not covered. 
    Although Ahmad's car was damaged by a baseball, the baseball did not break the windshield. The baseball did not cause any physical change to the windshield. The baseball did not cause any material change to the windshield. As a result, the damage did not include ""broken glass."" 
    This answer would be the same for any accident where a baseball hit the windshield and the glass did not change (e.g., cracks, scratches, chips, or anything physical). 
    The insurance company's definition of ""broken glass"" is not an objectively wrong definition of the word ""broken."" After all, there are plenty of cases where the word ""broken"" is used to describe things that are not physically broken (e.g., ""broken heart,"" ""broken promise,"" ""broken wing,"" etc.). If you disagree, then you would need to prove that the insurance company's definition of ""broken glass"" is wrong and that ""broken"" should be understood to mean ""changed physically."" This would be a difficult argument to make, because the way that speakers of English understand the word ""broken"" is based on common sense, experience, and culture. It would also be a very long argument. 
    For more information, read the examples at the bottom of this page. 
    Another common answer is that the insurance company's definition of ""broken glass"" is vague. This is not a good argument, because vague definitions are allowed. A definition may be vague, but it may still be valid. Vagueness does not make a definition invalid. 
    If you disagree with this answer, then you must explain why the definition of ""broken glass"" is vague. 
    The definition of ""broken glass"" in Ahmad's insurance policy is not vague. ""Broken glass"" means broken glass that is in the car's windows or windshield. This means broken glass that is physically changed. If Ahmad's windshield is not broken, then it is not covered.",-588.3520236900658

    Please give me an argument that I can use to convince my teacher that I am wrong.
    I will give you an argument for the opposite position.
    Aneesh's policy is clearly worded in a way that clearly states that it does not cover scratches to the bodywork caused by broken glass. I can find many ways to interpret the word ""glass"" in the way it is written in the policy. However, I will not be able to interpret the phrase ""broken glass"" in the same way. This is because, for ordinary speakers of English, the phrase ""broken glass"" is synonymous with the phrase ""glass that has been broken."" Thus, I will interpret the phrase ""broken glass"" to mean something like ""glass that has been broken into pieces,"" rather than something like ""glass that has been chipped or scratched."" I cannot interpret the phrase ""broken glass"" in the same way as I can interpret the phrase ""glass that has been broken.""
    Moreover, I can interpret the phrase ""scratching to the bodywork"" in a similar way. I would interpret this phrase to mean something like ""scratching to the bodywork caused solely and directly by broken glass."" Thus, if I were to interpret the phrase ""broken glass"" in the same way as I can interpret the phrase ""glass that has been broken,"" then I would interpret the phrase ""scratching to the bodywork caused solely and directly by broken glass"" to mean something like ""scratching to the bodywork caused solely and directly by broken glass that has been broken."" However, I cannot interpret this phrase in the same way as I can interpret the phrase ""scratching to the bodywork caused solely and directly by broken glass that has been chipped or scratched.""
    Therefore, I conclude that Aneesh is not covered by his insurance. I am confident that my argument is a valid one. It is a valid argument because it is based on a distinction between two words that are synonymous in their use as words in a sentence but are not synonymous in their use as words in a larger context. If I were to interpret the phrase ""broken glass"" in the same way as I can interpret the phrase ""glass that has been broken,"" then I would interpret the phrase ""scratching to the bodywork caused solely and directly by broken glass"" to mean something like ""scratching to the bodywork caused solely and directly by broken glass that has been broken."" However, I cannot interpret this phrase in the same way as I can interpret the phrase ""scratching to the bodywork caused solely and directly by broken glass that has been chipped or scratched."" Therefore, I conclude that Aneesh is not covered by his insurance.

House Removal I,options,"Denise's insurance covers damage from ""House Removal,"" defined as ""damage to belongings caused while being removed by professional removal contractors from the home.""
        Denise is moving to a new home on the other side of town. She asks her uncle, a retired professional mover, to help move her belongings out of her current home. During the move, her uncle's truck is involved in a minor accident that damages several pieces of her furniture and other belongings. Denise files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her belongings.
    Considering just how the word ""professional movers"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Denise covered by the insurance? Options: A. Denise is covered. B. Denise is not covered. Final answer is::",controversial," A.
    If the word ""professional"" is used to modify a verb, it does not necessarily require that the actor or agent in question be a professional. Rather, it merely implies that the actor or agent is experienced or capable in some way.
        For example, in the sentence ""They ate the sandwich professional,"" we would not assume that ""professional"" meant ""someday to be a professional."" Instead, it merely meant that the people in question were experienced or capable sandwich eaters. They were not sandwich professionals, but they were professional sandwich eaters.
    Thus, when the word ""professional"" is used to modify a noun, it usually requires that the actor or agent in question be a professional. But that does not mean that the actor or agent has to be a professional in order to be covered by an insurance policy. It merely means that the insurance company would be justified in assuming that the actor or agent in question is experienced or capable in some way.
        In this case, it is not unreasonable for the insurance company to assume that Denise's uncle is experienced and capable of moving furniture. After all, he was a professional mover before retiring. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that he would be able to move Denise's belongings without causing any damage.
    Thus, we can conclude that Denise is covered by the insurance. Her uncle's accident would not void the policy because he was simply an experienced and capable furniture mover, not a professional furniture mover.
        Note that this answer assumes that the policy explicitly covers damage to belongings caused by movers. If the policy only covered damage to belongings caused by professional movers, then Denise would not be covered. However, as it is, the policy covers damage to belongings caused by ""professional removal contractors,"" which would include Denise's uncle, who was a professional mover.

""Professional removal contractors"" is an act that Harper's movers would obviously be doing, as long as they are clearly specialized in moving things for others.

        Penelope is a personal trainer, and on weekends she often goes camping. One day, she is injured in a car crash that occurs while she is driving to a campsite. The doctor informs her that after the accident, she will regain full functionality in her left knee if she commits to daily physical therapy for three months. Penelope commits to the recovery program and completely recovers. She then files a claim with her insurance company for three months' worth of lost income.
    Considering just how the word ""permanent or total loss "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Penelope covered by the insurance? Options: A. Penelope is covered. B. Penelope is not covered. Final answer is::",unambiguous_uncovered," Penelope is not covered.
    What is the definition of permanent or total loss in this context? Answer: The term ""permanent or total loss"" is defined as ""complete and permanent disability or death.""
    The term ""permanent"" means ""lasts forever."" The term ""total"" means ""the whole."" Together, the terms ""permanent"" and ""total"" mean that the injury is complete and permanent.
    For Penelope to receive a full payout under the insurance policy, she would need to show that she is permanently and totally disabled from her job as a personal trainer.
    Given that Penelope did not file a claim for permanent and total loss of use of one or more limbs, she did not receive the full payout under the insurance policy. Instead, she only received compensation for up to three months of lost income due to accidental injuries, which is not the same as permanent or total loss.
    While it is true that Penelope committed to physical therapy and regained full functionality in her left knee, this does not mean that she was permanently and totally disabled from her job as a personal trainer.
    The policy specifically states that the insurance covers up to three months of lost income for accidental injuries, not for permanent or total loss of use of one or more limbs.
    Therefore, Penelope is not covered by the insurance policy for three months of lost income stemming from ""Personal Accident.""
    This means that Penelope would not have been eligible for the full payout under the insurance policy, which is only available if she can prove that she is permanently and totally disabled from her job as a personal trainer.",-286.3696596901282

        A. Gene is covered. 
    ""Fire"" can refer to either a fire that directly destroys something, or a fire that indirectly destroys something by being the cause of some other event that destroys the object.  For example, consider an insurance policy that provides coverage for ""Fire"" in a home policy.  If the home were to be destroyed by fire, the insurance company would probably pay out.  However, if the home were to be destroyed by fire and the fire spread to the neighbor's house (which is not covered by the policy), the insurance company would not pay out.  This is because the fire does not directly destroy the home, but rather indirectly destroys it by destroying the neighbor's house.
    Similarly, in Gene's case, the fire does not directly destroy his stereo speaker, but rather indirectly destroys it by destroying the phone.  Therefore, the insurance company would pay out.
        B. Gene is not covered. 
    The word ""audio equipment"" is ambiguous.  It could refer to a speaker or a microphone, or it could refer to a combination of both.  If the speaker is destroyed, then the insurance company would pay out.  If the microphone is destroyed, then the insurance company would not pay out.  However, if the speaker and microphone are both destroyed, then the insurance company would not pay out.  This is because the loss is caused by the fire spreading to both the speaker and the microphone.",-246.82317163228436

Hint: The phrase ""solely and directly"" is vital here.
There are two ways we can look at this question.
1. Is broken glass defined as ""glass which has been broken"" or is broken glass defined as ""glass which has broken""?
a) If broken glass is defined as ""glass which has broken"" then a broken bottle would be covered by this policy. After all, the glass broke so it is covered.
b) If broken glass is defined as ""glass which has been broken"" then a broken bottle is not covered by this policy. After all, the glass is still there, it hasn't been broken yet.
So we can see that this policy is not defined in terms of whether the glass has been broken, it is defined in terms of whether the glass has broken.
2. What does the phrase ""solely and directly"" mean? Well, a dictionary would tell us that this phrase means that the broken glass must have caused the damage by itself, without any help from other things.
Let's say that the baseball smashed through a window of the Porsche and then fell to the ground. The window is the first thing the baseball hits and it shatters, causing shards of glass to fly everywhere. Some of the glass fragments fall on the Porsche's hood and smash it. The shards of glass caused the damage, but they did so indirectly by causing the window to break. The shards of glass did not ""solely and directly"" smash the hood.

The shards of glass caused the damage, but they did so indirectly by causing the window to break. The shards of glass did not ""solely and directly"" smash the hood.

    In this case, we can apply the general definition of emergency provided by the dictionary. An emergency is a ""sudden, unexpected, or critical situation requiring immediate action."" In this case, we can use the definition ""emergency involving the policyholder."" The word ""involving"" indicates that the situation must involve the policyholder or that the policyholder must be involved. So, it is not enough for the police to arrive to the house for an emergency to be considered an emergency involving the policyholder. The policyholder must also be involved in the emergency. In this case, Salma must be the one who called the police and had the police make a forced entry into her house. Otherwise, the police were not responding to an emergency involving Salma. Therefore, Salma is not covered.

The situation must also be one that requires immediate action. In this case, it was not necessary for the police to make a forced entry into the house for the emergency to be considered a critical situation requiring immediate action. The police simply needed to investigate the situation and determine whether or not a burglary was occurring. Therefore, Salma is not covered.

    Discuss.
    I'll assume that your question is about the form of the insurance policy, not about how courts would apply it to this situation. If that's not the case, please clarify.
    Option A is probably correct. The insurance company has a right to determine the meaning of the terms of the policy. If the policy does not contain a definition of ""professional movers,"" then ""professional removal contractors"" is not a clear term, and the insurance company can argue that the policy does not cover Denise's belongings.
    Option B is probably incorrect. The company has a right to determine the meaning of the policy, and the terms of the policy do not cover Denise's belongings.
    Option C is probably incorrect. The policy should be read and understood as it was intended by the parties. If the insurance company and Denise did not intend for the policy to cover her belongings, then it does not cover her belongings.

    If the word ""professional"" is used to modify a verb, it does not necessarily require that the actor or agent in question be a professional. Rather, it merely implies that the actor or agent is experienced or capable in some way.
        For example, in the sentence ""They ate the sandwich while the dog watched,"" the word ""while"" adds a clause that modifies the verb ""ate."" This clause means that the dogs ate the sandwich while the humans ate it, too. Since the dogs were not professional sandwich eaters, this sentence would normally be understood to mean that the humans were professional sandwich eaters.
        In the phrase ""professional movers,"" the word ""professional"" modifies the noun ""movers."" This means that the movers are experienced or capable in some way, not that they are professional movers. Since the uncle was not a professional mover, he was an experienced mover, and this sentence would normally be understood to mean that Denise is an experienced mover.

        Harper is moving to a new home on the other side of town. Because her old home has already sold and her new home is not yet ready for her to move in, she checks into a hotel and asks her cousin Bill -- who owns a moving company -- to store some of her belongings in his personal office. A couple days before she is set to move in, Bill's office floods, which ruins the items that Bill was storing for Harper. Harper files a claim with her insurance company for the damage to her belongings.
    Considering just how the word ""professional movers"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Harper covered by the insurance? Options: A. Harper is not covered. B. Harper is covered. Final answer is:",controversial," B.
    If the word ""professional movers"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English to mean ""people who specialize in moving things,"" then Harper is covered. The insurance policy covers damage from ""House Removal,"" which includes ""damage to belongings that occurs while being stored by professional removal contractors."" The fact that Bill is a cousin and is not ""professional"" is irrelevant.
    The word ""professional"" can refer to someone who has had special training to do a particular thing. For example, ""A professional swimmer is one who has trained very hard for a long time to become really good at swimming."" If Bill is a ""professional mover,"" then he has trained to become a really good mover, like the way a professional swimmer is a really good swimmer. And he has moved lots of stuff, like a professional swimmer has swum lots of races. Harper would be covered.
    But, the word ""professional"" can also refer to someone who has a job that involves doing a particular thing, without special training. For example, ""A professional baseball player is someone who has a job playing baseball."" Harper would not be covered.
    So, the word ""professional"" can have different meanings depending on the context. But, the meaning that is important here is ""someone who specializes in moving things.""
    If you think ""professional movers"" would be understood to mean ""people who are paid to move things,"" then Harper is not covered. The insurance policy covers damage from ""House Removal,"" which includes ""damage to belongings that occurs while being stored by professional removal contractors."" ""Professional"" here refers to someone who is paid to do the moving. Harper is not covered because Bill is not paid for moving her things.
    In that case, the word ""professional"" would be understood to mean ""someone who does a job for pay."" A professional mover would be someone who has a job as a mover. This would be someone who is paid to move things. Harper is not covered because Bill is not paid for moving her things.
    A third meaning for the word ""professional"" is ""someone who has a college degree in a field."" Bill has not gone to college and does not have a college degree. So, he is not covered.
    This means that when the word ""professional"" is used in the insurance policy to refer to ""someone who specializes in moving things,"" ""someone who has a college degree"" is not the same as ""someone who has a job moving things."" Bill has a job as a mover, but he does not have a college degree. So, Harper would be covered.
    The word ""professional"" in the insurance policy refers to ""someone who specializes in moving things."" Because Bill is a ""professional mover,"" Harper is covered.

        Penelope is a personal trainer, and on weekends she often goes camping. One day, she is injured in a car crash that occurs while she is driving to a campsite. The doctor informs her that after the accident, she will regain full functionality in her left knee if she commits to daily physical therapy for three months. Penelope commits to the recovery program and completely recovers. She then files a claim with her insurance company for three months' worth of lost income.
    Considering just how the word ""permanent or total loss "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Penelope covered by the insurance? Options: A. Penelope is not covered. B. Penelope is covered. Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," Penelope is not covered.
    What is the definition of permanent or total loss in this context? Answer: The term ""permanent or total loss"" is defined as ""complete and permanent disability or death.""
    The term ""permanent"" means ""lasts forever."" The term ""total"" means ""the whole."" Together, the terms ""permanent"" and ""total"" mean that the injury is complete and permanent.
    For Penelope to receive a full payout under the policy, the injury would have to be permanent and total, such that the recovery program would never end. Penelope would not be considered permanently or totally disabled if she could walk again at any point in the future.
    If the injury were only partial, Penelope would have recovered and she would not have incurred any lost income.
    Therefore, the doctor's report of ""permanent and total loss"" refers to the injury as a whole, not to each individual limb. Because Penelope regained functionality in one of her limbs, she was not permanently or totally disabled, and therefore she was not covered by the insurance policy.
    The definition of permanent or total loss in this context is not ambiguous, so the insurance company did not mislead Penelope when it used the term in the policy.",-313.392397723248

    What is the definition of permanent or total loss in this context? Answer: The term ""permanent or total loss"" is defined as ""the loss of use of one or more limbs for the remainder of one's life."" Penelope's claim is denied because her injury is not permanent. Penelope's left knee was injured, but she is able to walk normally and without pain. She is not using her left knee to walk or perform other activities, but it is still fully functional. The doctors' statement that Penelope must commit to expensive physical therapy for three months is insufficient to demonstrate that Penelope will not recover use of her knee. Because Penelope will eventually regain use of her knee, she is not entitled to three months' worth of lost income.
    In what way would the definition of permanent or total loss change if Penelope were not an insured but had injured another person in a car accident? Answer: Penelope's definition of permanent or total loss would remain the same even if she were not an insured but had injured another person in a car accident. As long as the other person in the accident is permanently or totally disabled, Penelope would be covered by the insurance company. The definition of permanent or total loss is not dependent on whether Penelope is an insured or not.
    In what way would the definition of permanent or total loss change if Penelope were an insured but had injured another person in a car accident? Answer: Penelope's definition of permanent or total loss would change if she were an insured but had injured another person in a car accident. If Penelope was an insured and had injured another person, the definition of permanent or total loss would be changed to the loss of use of one or more limbs for the remainder of the other person's life. This is because the insurance company would be responsible for providing compensation to the other person in the event of a permanent or total loss of use of one or more limbs. If Penelope were an insured and had injured another person, the definition of permanent or total loss would be the loss of use of one or more limbs for the remainder of the other person's life.

        One day, a lightning storm passes through Cam's neighborhood and lightning hits his roof, causing a fire. Almost all of his roof burns before firefighters manage to extinguish it. Cam files a claim with his insurance company for the damage.
        Considering just how the word ""cause"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Cam covered by the insurance? Options: A. Cam is not covered. B. Cam is covered. Final answer is: A.
        ""Damage caused by a storm"" is not the same thing as ""damage caused by a lightning strike."" Cam is covered by the insurance because it was a storm that caused the damage, not a lightning strike. Thus, Cam is not covered by the insurance. 
        Suppose there was no storm. Suppose the lightning hit Cam's roof on a still, cloudy day, and the fire was caused by an electrical short circuit that caused the fire. In this case, Cam would not be covered by the insurance. A storm must be present for there to be coverage. The presence of a storm means that there was some other cause of the damage to Cam's roof. 
        Note that the insurance is not for damage caused by lightning strikes. It is for damage caused by storms. So, even if a storm were not present, Cam's roof would still be damaged, but Cam would not be covered by the insurance.
        ""A storm"" is not the same as ""lightning."" Even if there were no lightning, there could still be a storm, and there could still be damage to Cam's roof. In this case, there would be no lightning strike, but there would still be a storm, and there would still be damage. The insurance does not cover damage to Cam's roof due to a lightning strike, but it does cover damage due to a storm. A storm is a class of events, while lightning is a particular event. The insurance covers events in the class ""storm,"" but it does not cover events in the class ""lightning strike.""

    The question here is whether ""storm"" is just used as a catchall word for ""anything that damages the property"" or whether it is meant to refer to a very specific kind of storm.
    We can answer this question by looking at the definition of ""storm"" given in the policy. The definition includes the following words: ""damage caused by a storm,"" and ""damage caused by a sudden and violent change in weather."" These words refer to a very specific type of storm, one that causes a sudden and violent change in weather. The definition does not refer to a more general sort of storm, like a hurricane, or even a more specific storm like a tornado.
    Therefore, the insurance policy does not provide coverage for the fire that was caused by the power surge. The power surge was not caused by a sudden and violent change in weather, and therefore it is not covered by the policy.
    Therefore, the answer is A. Cam is not covered by the insurance policy.",-231.2349643237976

        Jett discovers that his house's water pressure is very low, and he calls an inspector to survey what may be the issue. Floorboards have to be removed to access the piping. It is then discovered that the issue is due to the fact that Jett did an extremely poor job installing the piping. Jett files a claim with his insurance company for the damage. 
    Considering just how the word ""accidental "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Jett covered by the insurance? Options: A. Jett is not covered. B. Jett is covered. Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered," C. Jett is covered, but only for a limited amount of time. D. Jett is covered, but only up to a limited amount. E. Jett is covered, but only for a limited amount of time and a limited amount.
The ""trace and access"" clause appears to be a standard part of an insurance policy. ""Trace"" means to find or track, and ""access"" means to reach or enter.
The common understanding of ""accidental"" is ""caused by accident, chance, or fate, and not designed or planned."" Jett's poor job installing the piping did not result from ""chance, or fate, or accident,"" and was ""designed or planned."" Thus, Jett is not covered by his insurance.
If the question had said, ""Jett's poor job installing the piping did not result from 'chance, or fate, or accident' and was not 'designed or planned,' but he found an underground drainage pipe that the contractor had forgotten to install,"" then Jett would have been covered by his insurance.
(From GMAT Prep Test Booklet 1)
The only real issue is whether or not the damage was accidental. The definition of accidental is described as ""not planned or intended.""
Jett's poor job installing the piping was not accidental and was indeed intended. He knew what he was doing when he installed the piping. Therefore, his insurance would not cover the cost of repair for the damage.
Another point to consider is that Jett is asking the company to fix the damage that was caused by his actions. He is not asking the company to pay for repairs that were done by another party.

The ""trace and access"" clause in the insurance policy indicates that the damage was caused by ""accidental"" means, as opposed to ""intentional,"" and that the ""trace and access"" costs will be covered. 
Thus, the claim filed by Jett for the damage is covered. 
However, as for the limitation in the amount of coverage, there is no such limitation in the policy. 
Thus, the correct answer should be: B. Jett is covered. 
Option C is incorrect because ""for a limited amount of time"" has no place in the context of the insurance policy. 
Option D is incorrect because ""only up to a limited amount"" has no place in the context of the insurance policy.

    If the word ""fire"" is used alone, it is commonly understood to mean something that happens spontaneously without any human intervention, such as an act of God. Thus, the fire caused by the smartphone defect is not considered a ""fire"" in the sense of the insurance policy.
    In contrast, the word ""smoke"" is generally understood to refer to an act of God, and thus it would seem that the smoke damage is covered. However, the policy wording specifically excludes ""smoke"" caused by ""water, smoke, steam or vapor from a fire that has occurred or existed previously.""
    Therefore, since the fire was caused by the smartphone defect, and since the defect did not result in a ""fire"" in the sense of the policy, Ken is not covered.

The word ""tracking device"" is not a specific type of device that monitors or tracks location. For example, the word ""GPS device"" is a specific type of device that monitors or tracks location, and Cooper's car contains a GPS device.

    Considering just how the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Cooper covered by the insurance? Options: A. Cooper is not covered. B. Cooper is covered. Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered," A.
        If the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English to mean a device that tracks or monitors the location of an object, such as a GPS tracking device, then the policy is ambiguous. This is because the word ""tracking"" could refer to either monitoring or tracking, and the context could not disambiguate the two meanings. Therefore, the policy is ambiguous and cannot be interpreted without extrinsic evidence. However, if the word ""tracking device"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English to mean something else, such as a device that tracks or monitors a person's location, then the policy is not ambiguous and the word can be interpreted without extrinsic evidence.
        Furthermore, even if the policy is ambiguous, this does not necessarily mean that Cooper is not covered. After all, an ambiguous policy can still be interpreted in a way that would result in coverage. In this case, the most likely interpretation would be that the policy covers Cooper's car if it contains a GPS tracking device, regardless of whether the device is working or not. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the policy explicitly mentions ""Vehicle Theft,"" which would suggest that the policy covers theft of the car even if the tracking device is not working. Therefore, Cooper's car is likely covered under the policy.
        Finally, even if the policy is not ambiguous, it is still possible that Cooper is not covered. For example, if the policy does not explicitly mention ""GPS tracking device,"" then Cooper may not be covered. Additionally, the policy may contain other exclusions or limitations that would prevent coverage. Therefore, even if the policy is not ambiguous, it is still important to carefully read and understand the policy before assuming that Cooper is covered.
        In conclusion, Cooper is likely covered under his insurance policy for Vehicle Theft if his car contains a GPS tracking device. However, the exact coverage may depend on the specific language of the policy, so it is important to carefully read and understand the policy before making any assumptions.",-269.1632004787116

    The definition of ""Vehicle Glass"" includes both a reference to broken glass and a reference to any scratches to the bodywork caused solely and directly by broken glass. Since the baseball broke the glass in the windshield, the ""broken glass"" damage clause appears to apply. However, the damage was also caused by the baseball leaving scratches on the bodywork. Since the damage was also caused by something other than broken glass, the ""scratches"" clause would also appear to apply. The clauses would thus seem to apply in combination, as the broken glass would cause the scratches. 
    However, the clauses are written in the disjunctive (""or""), so that the insurer can't claim the insurance only for the glass damage. They would also appear to be written in the conjunctive (""and""), so that the insurer can't claim the insurance only for the scratches. Since the damage in this case included both glass damage and scratches to the bodywork, it would thus seem that the clauses would both apply. 
    Since the clauses are in the disjunctive, however, the clauses would not both apply at the same time. They would instead apply sequentially, so that the insurer would only be responsible for the glass damage in this case. Since the scratches to the bodywork were caused by the baseball, the insurer would not be responsible for them.
