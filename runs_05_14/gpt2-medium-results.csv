There are two possibilities that Carol's insurance might cover:

While abroad, her house suffers from an electrical short circuit that causes a severe fire, damaging nearly the entire home. Vivian files a claim with her insurance company for the damages. 
Considering just how the word ""temporarily removed"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Vivian covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,yes," yes!
From the insurance company, they had to prove that Vivian had not been away ""temporarily"" (excess time) and that there was not a ""substantial chance"" that she would ever return. They also had to prove that the fire was ""temporarily"" caused. They had to prove that Vivian lost the house at the time the fire occurred.
There are two possibilities that Vivian would have had a ""temporarily"" covered property:

Goods Carrying Vehicle: Loss or Damage to Vehicle,yes_or_no,"Peter has insurance that covers ""Loss or Damage to a Goods Carrying Vehicle,"" which includes ""key replacement in the case of theft.""
As part of his bakery business, Peter owns a van which he uses to make local deliveries. One day, Peter realizes he has lost the key to the van. Replacing the key costs Peter hundreds of dollars. Peter files a claim with his insurance company for his losses.
Considering just how the word ""key theft "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Peter covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,He," He is not. He can be, but not under the law, thanks to the common sense principle of ""unjust enrichment.""
The fact that Peter is not covered by his insurance may be relevant to your own situation. For example, a teenager is driving his vehicle off the road, and the driver does not stop to check for his car keys. But at that moment, the teen would have a duty to check that his vehicle is safe. If Peter wants his vehicle to be covered by his insurance, he must take steps to protect himself from such an accident.

As part of his bakery business, Peter owns a van which he uses to make local deliveries. One day, Peter is mugged by an individual who takes the key to the van. Replacing the key costs Peter hundreds of dollars. Peter files a claim with his insurance company for his losses.
Considering just how the word ""key theft "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Peter covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,He," He is not. He can't, and doesn't need to, pay his losses if his van has been stolen. ( A New Yorker article on the subject covers the basics of how this works .)
We have a few more possibilities to consider. First, we might ask if Peter would be likely to replace the van if his insurance cover was lost. But at that point, it could be argued that the insurance would only cover the van's value. Peter might have no idea that the value of his van is less than it was, and that such a loss would be covered by the insurance. This might work, but it's not a compelling reason to replace the",

The fact that Peter is not covered by insurance under the law suggests that he doesn't want to pay the insurance premiums for the van, but rather wants the insurance company to find a buyer who will pay his losses and cover his losses.
So, he signs a false form stating that he's willing to pay the premiums. He pays the premiums, but he knows that the insurance company will not provide coverage for his van if he does not deliver the",

• the wind gusts from the same location at night;
• the height of the wind chill, and
• the wind speed in the area.

We have seen before that many homeowners do not have insurance for windows that are installed after the homeowner's deadline. In other words, a homeowner will often charge a premium for the window that is installed after the homeowner's deadline and the homeowner's deadline is often shorter than the expiration date for the insurance. If the window was installed after the homeowner's deadline, the homeowner may have to pay a premium for the window that has been installed after the homeowner's deadline.

I have been making this point for some time, but it bears repeating. Once you buy homes for a certain cost (mine are around $300k), it's best to stick to a plan that includes proper risk management. If you can afford to spend more than $300k on your property, it's unlikely you will sell it in the next year.
In my opinion, the cheapest way to protect yourself from future home price bubbles is to buy a home, build a solid foundation, and move away from the area in which your home is situated. If you can afford it, of course you can own a home.

Some background on the root of the term ground heave : Basically, the ground heave is where something is shifted about the side of the structure. To find out what's happening behind your house, you need to study the structural data that you have on your home. I'll tell you how it works.

From the reviews of the fire insurance and furnace insurance,  it seems that Madison's insurance will pay only for her house, but not for her furnaces or energy heating units.  If she doesn't want to pay for these types of failures, she would need to pay out of pocket.

All I can tell you is that when I asked him about the claim, I did not get the same response.

Gene notices and manages to extinguish the fire before it totals the car, but not before the fire spreads to one of his car's stereo speakers, which was adjacent to the phone.  Gene files a claim with his insurance company for the loss.

This is a typical example of some of the claims that insurance companies make with their policy holders ( A New Yorker calls this one ""awkward""). 
And again, the standard answer from insurance companies is to cancel the policy and move on.  If the policyholder is really covered, they do not cover this claim, or at least, they don't make it a deductible.

If there is no insurance coverage for such damages, the insurance company would not pay for them. In other words, insurance would cover the damage at the time the insurance cover would apply. If the insurance covers the damage during the flood event, then insurance would pay for",
Flood II,agreement_negation,"Rebecca has insurance that covers damage from ""Flooding"" to her home, defined as ""an invasion of the property by a large volume of water caused by a rapid build-up from outside the buildings.""
    Rebecca lives in a house situated next to a small creek.

Rebecca files a claim with her insurance company for the damage.

 Rebecca would surely have been covered by her insurance if she had been drinking the water from the creek. But there is no insurance company willing to pay for the damage. The insurance company is reluctant to be responsible for damages that would have been caused by the rain. So when the creek floods, the claim must be paid for by the insurance company.

Vivian had the house in good repair when she left, but with the house on fire, she needed to purchase a new house, and she couldn't afford it.

Her house now has fire insurance, and Vivian will be able to sell the house for a considerable profit. I doubt that she would buy a new house before the damages were repaired.
