Loss and Accidental Damage,yes_or_no,"Vivian has home insurance for ""Loss and Accidental Damage,"" which only applies if the damage occurs ""while temporarily away from home anywhere in the world.""
Vivian lives alone in a single-family house in the suburbs. She decides to permanently move abroad, but she keeps the deed to her house so that her children can inherit it one day. While abroad, her house suffers from an electrical short circuit that causes a severe fire, damaging nearly the entire home. Vivian files a claim with her insurance company for the damages. 
Considering just how the word ""temporarily removed"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Vivian covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_uncovered,No," No!
From the insurance company's perspective, the house is not ""temporarily away from home"" when it suffers an electrical short circuit. The insurance company is simply covering a temporary loss. If the house were to completely burn down, the insurance company would no longer cover the home and the claim would be dismissed. It's a simple and straightforward example of how the law is applied in Canada's insurance industry.
What's wrong with Vivian's claim? Nothing. Vivian's insurance company will pay for her home damages,",

From the insurance company's perspective, the house fire was caused by a common human problem, not a rare (and unpredictable) occurrence. The insurance company is simply letting Vivian off the hook, because it has determined that there's no specific reason for her to have been away from home for a long time. It's a common claim, and a case the insurance company could make for any number of reasons. In fact, from the insurance company's perspective, it's perfectly normal for a house fire to take place while a person is away from home.",

One day, a hail storm hits Rick's house and causes damage to his roof's clay shingles. Many shingles are chipped and some even develop large cracks, causing the roof to leak. Rick files a claim with his insurance company for the damage.
Considering just how the word ""hard surface"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Rick covered by the insurance?? Yes or No? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,He," He is not. The insurance company, however, will cover some or all of the damage, even if the roof leaks. A homeowner's policy must specifically declare what is covered and under what circumstances.
We have a few examples of homeowners insurance policies that state that homeowners will cover damage caused by hail, snow, rain, dust storms, etc., but leave out hail damage: 
• American National Home Insurance Company, Inc. Insured by American National Home Insurance Company, Inc., a subsidiary of National Home Assurance Company. All hail damage is covered by this policy.

An insurance policy covers damage to the ""bodily integrity,"" or ""body,"" of another person. So when a storm hits your house and it causes a cut, break, or other damage to your home, your policy covers it.
An insurance policy does not cover damage to a soft surface such as a window, door, or window frame. One way to consider the question is to examine the definition of ""bodily integrity.""
To understand the definition of ""bodily integrity,""",

As part of his bakery business, Peter owns a van which he uses to make local deliveries. One day, Peter is mugged by an individual who takes the key to the van. Replacing the key costs Peter hundreds of dollars. Peter files a claim with his insurance company for his losses.
Considering just how the word ""key theft "" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Is Peter covered by the insurance?? No or Yes? Final answer is:",unambiguous_covered,He," He is not. The insurance company, however, will cover his losses if he presents proof of ""Key theft"" to the insurance company, and this proof is taken from a police report.
If the insurance company denies coverage, then Peter can be sued and held liable for his losses. This is not something that can be done lightly or cheaply, and it is unlikely to work.

Olivia is really angry. She wants her money back from the insurance company. The insurance company says No.
The fact that the insurance company says No is a complete red flag for Olivia. The company must be mad! It is obvious to her that the company would not stand for something like this. It's a violation of its rules to cut bait and sell a policy for a deductible that does not apply to the action.

From the insurance company's perspective, Gwen is not traveling in her car at all, but instead driving the entire length of the parking lot in which she was standing at the time of the accident. The company must include the ""personal accident"" clause in her policy. In short, if Gwen's wrist was injured while driving, the company would be compelled to pay for the damages caused by her negligence.

From the insurance company's perspective, it would be an unusual claim for Gwen to sue the driver of the other vehicle, because this would be an individual act of negligence on Gwen's part.

They must determine whether Gwen was driving safely or at fault, and if the driving was negligent or not. If the driving was negligent, they must act accordingly and pay the damages.

Rather, it is an important security measure which allows a barber to make a delivery in a safe, controlled environment. The key to a safe is a strong lock that can be easily and quickly changed. The barber replaces the key to the safe before he leaves the shop.

The barber can then get to the delivery before a customer gets suspicious.

    Considering just how the word ""rapid build-up"" would be understood by ordinary speakers of English, Rebecca is covered by the insurance. Do you disagree? Yes or No? Final answer is: Final answer is:",controversial,No," No!
From the standpoint of the insurance company, the threat of Flooding is not real. The insurance company only worries about the loss of money for the claim, and it is not concerned about the damage to Rebecca's house or the creek. No, the risk of Flooding is not real, and yet the insurance company does cover it, and it does so, even though there is no evidence that it ever would have been covered had it not been for Rebecca's claim.

From the standpoint of our English language, the key theft  is not theft at all. Rather, it is an important security measure which allows a barber to make a delivery in a safe, controlled environment. The key to a safe is a strong lock that can be easily and quickly changed. The barber replaces the key to the van before he leaves the shop. This is a keyless delivery.  In the case of the keyless delivery, the person who takes the key to the van is also protected by the insurance.

Your analysis shows that the fault system where the San Francisco earthquake occurred has a more than a fivefold difference in magnitude between the two fault systems.
This raises the question: what is the nature of this difference and",

From the standpoint of the fire department and the city, the original wording of the ""Escape of Oil"" law seems appropriate. The difference is in the definition of oil. The law states, ""If oil is found on a floor, it is considered to be oil leaking from a heating installation. It is not considered to be oil leaking from a faucet or a sink."" And this is true. In fact, the oil is considered to be oil leaking from the original oil-fired heater.

It would be interesting to know how common it is for insurance companies to deny claims for damage caused by sudden/unforseen water pressure changes in homes. I have seen claims denied for damage caused by sudden/unforseen water pressure changes in homes, and I have heard a few examples of claim denials for damage caused by sudden/unforseen water pressure changes in houses.
